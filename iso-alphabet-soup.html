ISO Alphabet Soup</h1>

<p>
The <a href="http://www.iso.org">International Organization for Standardization</a>, 
known as ISO, is the governing body under which C++ is standardized. To 
understand the C++ standardization process, you need to know the meaning of 
various ISO acronyms, some of which changed recently.</p>

<h2>ISO acronyms</h2>
<ul>
  <li>&quot;<b>TC</b>&quot; = &quot;Technical Corrigendum&quot; = bug-fix service-pack, such as C++03.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;<b>TS</b>&quot; = &quot;Technical Specification&quot; = newspeak for what  used to 
  be called a
  Type 2 TR, such as the Library TR (which would now be called the
  Library TS) -- something with technical meat but that's not quite ready for
  inclusion in an IS yet.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;<b>TR</b>&quot; = &quot;Technical Report&quot; = newspeak for what used to 
  be called a Type 3 TR, such as the Performance TR -- something more descriptive.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;</li>
  <li>&quot;<b>IS</b>&quot; = &quot;International Standard&quot; = a major or minor revision (such as&nbsp; C++98 and C++11) or for standalone material that for whatever
  reason should stand alone and is ready to be IS quality (such as 
  Special Math).</li>
</ul>
<p>TSs and ISs are most clearly appropriate for work that is separable, such as 
the Special 
Math IS.<br>
<br>
As an example, when the committee thinks technical work on the proposed Filesystem 
library is complete, the committee can decide whether to continue progress:</p>
<ul>
  <li>not at all;</li>
  <li>as a TS;</li>
  <li>as its own IS; or</li>
  <li>as part of the C++1y IS,</li>
</ul>
<p>depending on:</p>
<ul>
  <li>its quality (e.g., is it ready to be an IS?);</li>
  <li>its degree of coupling with existing library components (e.g., can it be decoupled to stand on its own as a TS or 
IS?);</li>
  <li>its urgency (e.g., do we want to ship it sooner than C++1y?);</li>
  <li>its impact on headers (e.g. changes to existing headers work better for 
  the next standard);</li>
  <li>its other qualities/desiderata (e.g., do we want to enable conformance to 
  it separately as with Special Math?).</li>
</ul>
<p>That decision will always be on a case-by-case basis.</p>
