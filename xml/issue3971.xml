<title>Join ranges of rvalue references with ranges of prvalues</title>

<p>
The issue that <tt>concat_view</tt> implicitly breaks equality-preserving by concatenating range of references with range 
of prvalues seems to be reflected in <tt>join_view</tt> as well.
<p/>
When the reference of the inner range is <tt>string&amp;&amp;</tt> and the reference of the pattern range is prvalue 
<tt>string</tt>, dereferencing its iterator will move the elements of the inner range to the returned <tt>string</tt>, 
which makes the second dereference get an empty <tt>string</tt> (<a href="https://godbolt.org/z/5YYzK5qsr">demo</a>):
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector v1{"hello"s};
vector v2{"world"s};
vector v{v1 | views::as_rvalue, v2 | views::as_rvalue};
auto pattern = views::iota(0, 1) | views::transform([](int) { return ", "s; });
ranges::forward_range auto joined = v | views::join_with(pattern);
fmt::print("{}\n", joined); // ["hello", ", ", "world"]
fmt::print("{}\n", joined); // <span style="color:red;font-weight:bolder">["", ", ", ""]</span>
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>Not sure if we should ban such less common case.</p>

<note>2024-03-19; Tokyo: feedback from SG9</note>
<p>
SG9 believe that LWG3971 is a use-after-move and is working as intended.
We further believe that matching the behavior of `concat_view`
(which is the current behavior) is important. This is not a defect.
