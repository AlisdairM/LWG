<title><tt>std::log</tt> misspecified for complex numbers</title>

<p>
The current specification of <tt>std::log</tt> is inconsistent for complex numbers, specifically, the Returns clause 
(<sref ref="[complex.transcendentals]"/>). On the one hand, it states that the imaginary part of the return value lies 
in the <em>closed</em> interval <tt>[-<i>i</i> &pi;, +<i>i</i> &pi;]</tt>. On the other hand, it says that "the branch 
cuts are along the negative real axis" and "the imaginary part of <tt>log(x)</tt> is <tt>+&pi;</tt> when <tt>x</tt> 
is a negative real number".
</p>
<p>
The inconsistency lies in the difference between the mathematical concept of a branch cut and the nature of floating 
point numbers in C++. The corresponding specification in the C standard makes it clearer that if <tt>x</tt> is a real 
number, then <tt>log(x + 0<i>i</i>) = +&pi;</tt>, but <tt>log(x - 0<i>i</i>) = -&pi;</tt>, i.e. they consider positive 
and negative zero to represent the two different limits of approaching the branch cut from opposite directions. In 
other words, the term "negative real number" is misleading, and in fact there are <em>two distinct</em> real numbers, 
<tt>x + 0<i>i</i></tt> and <tt>x - 0<i>i</i></tt>, that compare equal but whose logarithms differ by <tt>2 &pi; <i>i</i></tt>.
</p>
<p>
The resolution should consist of two parts:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Double-check that our usage and definition of "branch cut" is sufficiently unambiguous. The C standard contains 
a lot more wording around this that we don't have in C++.</p></li>
<li><p>Change the Returns clause of <tt>log</tt> appropriately. For example: "When <tt>x</tt> is a negative real number, 
<tt>imag(log(x + 0<i>i</i>))</tt> is <tt>&pi;</tt>, and <tt>imag(log(x - 0<i>i</i>))</tt> is <tt>-&pi;</tt>."</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Current implementations seem to behave as described in (2).
