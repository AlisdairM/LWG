<p>
<tt>std::basic_regex</tt> should have an allocator for all the
reasons that a <tt>std::string</tt> does. For example, I can use
<tt>boost::interprocess</tt> to put a <tt>string</tt> or <tt>vector</tt>
in shared memory, but not a <tt>regex</tt>.

<p>Close 1396 as NAD Future.</p>

<note>LEWG Kona 2017</note>
<p>Recommend Open: Covered in LEWG9, P0269, which is in wording review.</p>

<note>2020-07-17; status changed to Tentatively NAD in issue processing telecon</note>
<p>
P0269R0 has been superseded by P1294R0.
Requested LEWG to confirm which version they forwarded to LWG.
In any case, this is a feature request, not a defect, and will be dealt with as a proposal not an issue.
