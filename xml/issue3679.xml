The following is rejected by libstdc++:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

void call(std::ranges::istream_view&lt;int&gt;&amp; v);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The error is quite cryptic, but ultimately the issue is not including <tt>&lt;istream&gt;</tt>. I think 
this currently isn't required to work, so the fact that it does not work is conforming. But should it be 
required to work? 
<p/>
I think either this should work or we should add a note to <sref ref="[range.istream]"/> about the include.
