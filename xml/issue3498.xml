<p>
The synopsis in <sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.overview]"/> shows the move assignment operator and 
<tt>swap</tt> member as potentially throwing. The detailed descriptions in 
<sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.assign]"/> are <tt>noexcept</tt>.

<a href="https://wg21.link/p0053r7">P0053R7</a>, so this is nothing that could be resolved editorially.
