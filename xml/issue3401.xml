<p>
We have quite a few occurrences of the phrase "as if by" in <i>Effects:</i> elements in the 
library specification. Is the meaning of this phrase the same as "equivalent to"? If so, we 
should replace occurrences of "as if by" with "equivalent to" to make it clear that the magic 
"<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to" wording in <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> para 4 
is intended to apply.
