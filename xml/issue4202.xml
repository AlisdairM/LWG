We require an opt-in to satisfy the `sender` concept.
Making your type awaitable with an empty environment is one way to opt in.
If your awaitable requires an environment, you have two options:
<ul>
<li>give your awaitable type a nested `sender_concept` typedef, or</li>
<li>specialize `enable_sender` for your awaitable type.</li>
</ul>
The problem is that somewhere along the way,
the `enable_sender` variable template was turned into
an exposition-only <i><code>enable-sender</code></i> concept.
We should roll back that change.
