<title>Make new entities and names in namespace <tt>std</tt> conforming extensions</title>

<p>
Technically, right now, it is not a conforming extension to add a new function to namespace <tt>std</tt>. Doing so could cause 
unqualified lookup on the name of that function in the presence of a using directive to find a different function. This seems 
an unreasonable restriction on library vendors providing conforming extensions, as such a using directive seems inherently risky 
in unqualified name lookup.
</p>
<p>
<sref ref="[member.functions]"/> implies that adding overloads to a method <em>is</em> a conforming extension, and within some 
limits the same is true for global functions due to <sref ref="[global.functions]"/>.
<p/>
It would likely be useful to specify that other new entities are valid conforming extensions, or preclude them where they pose 
serious compatibility problems.
