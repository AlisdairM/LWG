<title>Postconditions vs. exceptions</title>

<p>
The front matter in clause 17 should clarify that postconditions will not hold if a
standard library function exits via an exception. Postconditions or guarantees that
apply when an exception is thrown (beyond the basic guarantee) are described in an
"Exception safety" section.
</p>

<p>
Consensus that we do not clearly say this, and that we probably should.  A likely
location to describe the guarantees of <i>postconditions</i> could well be a new
sub-clause following <sref ref="[res.on.required]"/> which serves the same purpose
for <i>requires</i> clauses. However, we need such wording before we can make
progress.
</p>

<p>
Also, see <iref ref="2137"/> for a suggestion that we want to see a paper resolving
both issues together.

<p>MC: Idea is to replace all such "If no exception" postconditions with "Exception safety" sections.</p>

<note>2021-06-20; Daniel comments</note>
<p>
An informal <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/3612">editorial change suggestion</a> has
recently been made whose editorial implementation would promote the idea that the default assumption is
that <i>Postconditions:</i> are only met if the function doesn't exit with an exception.
<p/>
After analyzing all current existing <i>Postconditions:</i> elements the following seems to hold: Affected
by this issue are only non-<tt>noexcept</tt> functions and mostly non-constructor functions (unless the
<i>Postconditions:</i> element says something about the value of its arguments). Most existing
<i>Postconditions</i> seem to be intended to apply only in non-exceptional cases. I found some where
this is presumably not intended, namely those of the expressions <tt>os &lt;&lt; x</tt> and
<tt>is &gt;&gt; v</tt> in Tables [tab:rand.req.eng] and [tab:rand.req.dist], maybe also
<sref ref="[time.zone.db.remote]"/> p4.
<p/>
Nonetheless, the editorial change seems to be applicable even without having this issue resolved, because
it doesn't actually change the normative state by itself.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <paper num="n4988"/>.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Change <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
(3.6) &mdash;
<i>Postconditions</i>: the conditions (sometimes termed observable results)
established by the function <ins>when a call to it returns normally</ins>.
</blockquote>
