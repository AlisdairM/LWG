<title>Postconditions vs. exceptions</title>

<p>
The front matter in clause 17 should clarify that postconditions will not hold if a 
standard library function exits via an exception. Postconditions or guarantees that 
apply when an exception is thrown (beyond the basic guarantee) are described in an 
"Exception safety" section.

<p>
Consensus that we do not clearly say this, and that we probably should.  A likely
location to describe the guarantees of <i>postconditions</i> could well be a new
sub-clause following <sref ref="[res.on.required]"/> which serves the same purpose
for <i>requires</i> clauses.  However, we need such wording before we can make
progress.
</p>

<p>
Also, see <iref ref="2137"/> for a suggestion that we want to see a paper resolving
both issues together.

<p>MC: Idea is to replace all such "If no exception" postconditions with "Exception safety" sections.</p>
