<p>
Otherwise, one could use memcpy to save and restore the value according to 3.9p2.
<p/>
It seems the core language rules in <sref ref="[class]"/>p6 with <sref ref="[class.copy]"/>p12 
(trivial copy constructor) etc. and <sref ref="[dcl.fct.def.default]"/>p5 (user-provided) say 
that the atomic types are trivially copyable, which is bad. We shouldn't rely on future core 
changes in that area and simply say in the library section <sref ref="[atomics.types.generic]"/> 
that these very special types are not trivially copyable.

<resolution>
<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[atomics.types.generic]"/>p3 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
Specializations and instantiations of the <tt>atomic</tt> template shall have a deleted copy constructor, a deleted
copy assignment operator, and a constexpr value constructor. <ins>They are not trivially copyable 
types (<sref ref="[basic.types]"/>).</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
