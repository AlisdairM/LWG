<sref ref="[thread.thread.constr]"/> p6 says
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
The completion of the invocation of the constructor synchronizes with the beginning of the invocation of the copy of `f`.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The intended meaning is that "The completion of the invocation of the constructor" happens-before 
"the beginning of the invocation of the copy of `f`.", so we can infer other happen-before relationships 
based on this point. 
<p/>
However, according to the definition of "happens-before" (<sref ref="[intro.races]"/> p7),
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
An evaluation <i>A</i> <i>happens before</i> an evaluation <i>B</i> (or, equivalently, <i>B</i> 
happens after <i>A</i>) if either
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(7.1) &mdash; [&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>(7.2) &mdash; <i>A</i> synchronizes with <i>B</i>, or</p></li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p>
That means <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> are first required to be expressions because the evaluation is 
in terms of expressions. 
<p/>
However, "The completion of the invocation of the constructor" and "the beginning of the invocation 
of the copy of `f`" are not expressions. 
<p/>
The similar issue is <sref ref="[thread.thread.member]"/> p4
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
The completion of the thread represented by `*this` synchronizes with (<sref ref="[intro.multithread]"/>) 
the corresponding successful `join()` return.
