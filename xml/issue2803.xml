<p/>
Specializations of <tt>std::hash</tt> for arithmetic, pointer, 
and standard library types should not be allowed to throw. The 
constructors, assignment operators, and function call operator 
should all be marked as <tt>noexcept</tt>.
It might be reasonable to consider making this a 
binding requirement on user specializations of the 
<tt>hash</tt> template as well (in p1) but that may be big a 
change to make at this stage.
