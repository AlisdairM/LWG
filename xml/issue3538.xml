<a href="https://wg21.link/p0551r3">P0551R3</a> has made almost all standard library functions non-addressable, 
including all functions from the C standard library. However, C17 (and the latest C23 working draft) explicitly 
allows taking address of a C standard library function in 7.1.4/1.
<p/>
Should we require something like "every function from the C standard library is addressable unless it is overloaded", 
in order to minimize the incompatibility with C? Or explicitly say something in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/> if 
such requirement is not wanted?
