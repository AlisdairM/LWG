<p>
LWG <iref ref="2676"/> specified <tt>basic_filebuf::open(const std::filesystem::path::value_type* s, ios_base::openmode mode)</tt> 
by simply reusing the specification for the <tt>const char*</tt> overload, but that specification is incorrect for the wide overload: 
it says that <tt>'s'</tt> is an NTBS &mdash; a null-terminated byte string &mdash; which it isn't. Moreover, it specifies that 
the file is opened as if by calling <tt>fopen(s, modstr)</tt>, but that call is ill-formed if s isn't a <tt>const char*</tt>.
