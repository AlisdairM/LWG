<p>
The specification for <tt>copy_symlink</tt> is (<sref ref="[fs.op.copy.symlink]"/>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Equivalent to <tt><i>function</i>(read_symlink(existing_symlink), new_symlink)</tt> 
or <tt><i>function</i>(read_symlink(existing_symlink, ec), new_symlink, ec)</tt>, respectively,
where in each case <tt><i>function</i></tt> is <tt>create_symlink</tt> or 
<tt>create_directory_symlink</tt> as appropriate.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The specification for <tt>read_symlink</tt> is (<sref ref="[fs.op.read.symlink]"/>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: If <tt>p</tt> resolves to a symbolic link, a path object containing the contents of 
that symbolic link.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
And finally, the definition of a "symbolic link" is (<sref ref="[fs.general]"/>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
A <i>symbolic link</i> is a type of file with the property that when the file is encountered during pathname
resolution (<sref ref="[fs.class.path]"/>), a string stored by the file is used to modify the pathname resolution.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
On Unix, <tt>symlink</tt> is the only kind of symbolic link. However, on Windows, there are symbolic 
link files which are <em>not</em> <tt>symlink</tt>s (app execution aliases and junctions) &mdash; this 
means that <tt>read_symlink</tt> should almost certainly get the target of these files if possible. 
However, <tt>copy_symlink</tt> specifically requires creating a <em><tt>symlink</tt></em>, not whatever 
type of file was there originally. IMO, <tt>copy_symlink</tt> should require its target to be a symlink. 
I think the original assumption was that <tt>read_symlink</tt> would take care of that for 
<tt>copy_symlink</tt>; this is clearly not the case on Windows, though.
