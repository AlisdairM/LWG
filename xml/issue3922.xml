<title>It's unclear whether <tt>numeric_limits</tt> can be specialized by users</title>

<p>
<sref ref="[namespace.std]"/>/p2 notes that "unless explicitly prohibited", a user may conditionally specialize 
any class template for program-defined types. <sref ref="[numeric.limits.general]"/>/p1 doesn't explicitly prohibit 
this, but it does create a bit of a grey area with its wording because it describes <tt>numeric_limits</tt> as a 
class template describing "the implementation's representation" of "the arithmetic types".
<p/>
Since this type is about what the implementation provides, and about arithmetic types only, it's not clear whether 
a user can specialize it for their own library type such as <tt>ns::int256</tt>. <tt>ns::int256</tt> isn't an 
arithmetic type (despite resembling one), so one can interpret <sref ref="[namespace.std]"/>/p2's (b) condition to 
mean that <tt>numeric_limits&lt;ns::int256&gt;</tt> needs to be explicitly specialized as if it were the primary 
template.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4944"/>.
