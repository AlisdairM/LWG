<p>
The paragraph is really trying to say two 
different things, and should be split into two 
paragraphs, using standard terminology.
</p>
<p>
Proposed change:
<p/>
The first sentence should become a 
<i>Requires:</i> clause, as it dictates 
requirements to callers.
<p/>
The second sentence should be a <i>Remarks:</i> 
clause, at is a normative requirement on the 
implementation.
