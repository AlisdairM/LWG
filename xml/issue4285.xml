Background: <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/8009">https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/8009</a>
<p/>
LWG <iref ref="461"/> changed `time_get::do_get_date` to parse a set of fixed formats. For example, if 
`time_get::date_order()` is `no_order` or `mdy`, the format parsed by `do_get_date` is `%m/%d/%y`.
<p/>
This has several problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>When the resolution of LWG <iref ref="461"/> was applied to the draft standard, the slashes were lost. 
This could mislead people into implementing `do_get_date` using the incorrect formats. Fortunately, none 
of the standard library implementations are affected by this mistake.</p></li>
<li><p>Only 2-digit years are accepted due to the use of `%y`. This could lead to incorrect parse if 
`strftime` uses `%Y` for the locale's date format.</p></li>
<li><p>`date_order()` might need additional locale facets to find out the date order, but it doesn't have an 
<tt>ios_base&amp;</tt> argument from which to get the locale.</p></li>
<li><p>Many locales do not use any of the specified formats. For example, `de_DE` uses `%d.%m.%Y`, `zh_CN` 
uses `%Y?%m?%d?`. Although <sref ref="[locale.time.get.virtuals]"/>/5 gives an implementation the latitude 
to accept additional formats, ambiguity could arise if the locale's format disagrees with `date_order()`.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
On POSIX systems, it is possible to query the locale's date format using `nl_langinfo(D_FMT)`. 
Maybe an implementation should be allowed to use that format <b>instead</b> of the one indicated by `date_order()`.
