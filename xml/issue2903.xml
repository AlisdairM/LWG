<p>The form of initialization for the emplace-constructors is not specified. We are very clear to mandate "as if by direct 
non-list initialization" for each constructor in <tt>optional</tt>, so there is no ambiguity regarding parens vs. braces. 
That wording idiom should be followed by <tt>variant</tt>.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Insert the phrase "as if direct-non-list-initializing" at appropriate locations in paragraphs 19, 23, 27, and 31</p>
