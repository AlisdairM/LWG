<p>
Condition variables preclude a wakeup optimization.
</p>

<note>
Resolution proposed by ballot comment:
</note>

<blockquote><p>
Change condition_variable to allow such
optimization. See Appendix 1 - Additional Details
</p></blockquote>

<p>
The Concurrency subgroup reviewed the issue, and deemed it an extension to be handled after C++0x.
</p>

<rationale><p>The LWG does not wish to make the change at this time.</p></rationale>

<note>LEWG Kona 2017</note>
<p>Recommend NAD: (N4618 numbering) 30.5.1[thread.condition.condvar] p10.3 allows spurious wakeups. This issue is out of date.</p>

<note>2017-03-01, Kona</note>
<p>
SG1 recommends: Close as NAD
<p/>
The approach suggested there raises all sorts of issues about <tt>thread_locals</tt>, etc. It's probably way too late 
to change this anyway, but this would have required a careful paper.
