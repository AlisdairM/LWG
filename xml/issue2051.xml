One of my constituents wrote the following:
<p/>
-------snip------------
<p/>
So far the only use I've found for <tt>std::tuple</tt> is as an ad-hoc type to emulate
multiple return values. If the tuple ctor was made non-explicit one could
almost think C++ supported multiple return values especially when combined
with <tt>std::tie()</tt>.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
// assume types line_segment and point
// assume function double distance(point const&amp;, point const&amp;)

std::tuple&lt;point, point&gt;
closest_points(line_segment const&amp; a, line_segment const&amp; b) {
 point ax;
 point bx;
 /* some math */

 return {ax, bx};
}


double
distance(line_segment const&amp; a, line_segment const&amp; b) {
 point ax;
 point bx;
 std::tie(ax, bx) = closest_points(a, b);

 return distance(ax, bx);
}
</pre></blockquote>

Some notes:
</p>
<ol>
<li><tt>pair</tt> allows such a return</li>
<li>a lambda with a deduced return type doesn't allow it for any type</li>
<li><tt>decltype</tt> refuses <tt>{1, 2}</tt></li>
</ol>
<p>
I would recommend making non-unary <tt>tuple</tt> constructors non-explicit.

Move to NAD Future, this would be an extension to existing functionality.

Move to Open at the request of the Evolution Working Group.

<p>VV: While in the area of tuples, http://cplusplus.github.io/LWG/lwg-active.html#2051 should have status of WP, it is resolved by Daniel's "improving pair and tuple" paper.</p>
