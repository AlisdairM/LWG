<p>
In <sref ref="[re.general]"/>, the character type used in the regex library (<tt>CharT</tt>), 
is only required to be "char-like". This means "<tt>struct A { int m; };</tt>" satisfies the 
requirements for <tt>CharT</tt>. Clearly there have to be more requirements for <tt>CharT</tt>.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Comparison operators such as "<tt>==</tt>" or "<tt>&lt;=</tt>" must be defined between <tt>CharT</tt> 
objects, because these operators are used throughout the text of the <sref ref="[re]"/> chapter. (Similarly, 
"<tt>==</tt>" between a <tt>CharT</tt> object and integer <tt>0</tt> must also be defined.)
<p/>
Alternatively, we can also interpret these operators in the text, as routines implemented by 
"<tt>std::char_traits&lt;CharT&gt;</tt>" comparison functions. This interpretation has the advantage 
of keeping <sref ref="[re]"/> consistent with the strings library and string comparisons (which are 
also used in <sref ref="[re]"/>).</p></li>
<li><p>There must be a way to convert between <tt>CharT</tt> and <tt>char</tt>, otherwise there is no 
way to recognize regex syntactical characters, such as <tt>'*'</tt> or <tt>'+'</tt>. One way is to simply 
do a type conversion from <tt>char</tt> to <tt>CharT</tt> (which requires <tt>char</tt> to be convertible 
to <tt>CharT</tt>). But this doesn't allow us to convert between character encodings.
<p/>
Alternatively, if we have an object of the <tt>Traits</tt> class (<sref ref="[re.grammar]"/> paragraph 2) 
denoted <tt>v</tt>, we can use "<tt>use_facet&lt;ctype&lt;CharT&gt;&gt;(v.getloc()).widen</tt>" to convert 
from <tt>char</tt> to <tt>CharT</tt>. This allows us to convert between character encodings. This requires 
that we can actually get this facet from this locale object.
