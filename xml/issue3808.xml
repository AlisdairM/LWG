<p>
<tt>ranges::shift</tt> is seemingly the only ranges algorithm that incremented the value of an existing feature test macro.
<p/>
From what I can tell the only other one that could have done that but didn't is <tt>__cpp_lib_starts_ends_with</tt>.
<p/>
Should there have been a <tt>__cpp_lib_ranges_shift</tt> or should have <tt>__cpp_lib_starts_ends_with</tt> incremented 
its value when the ranges algorithms were added?
