<p>
When a shared-state is released, it may be necessary to execute user defined code for the destructor of a 
stored value or exception. It is unclear whether the execution of said destructor constitutes an observable side effect.
</p>
<p>
While discussing N4445 in Lenexa, Nat Goodspeed pointed out that <sref ref="[futures.state]"/>/5.1 does not explicitly 
mention the destruction of the result, so implementations should be allowed to release (or reuse) a shared state ahead 
of time under the "as-if" rule.
<p/>
The standard should clarify whether the execution of destructors is a visible side effect of releasing a shared state.
