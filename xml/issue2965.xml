As pointed out by Jonathan Wakely and Bo Persson, <sref ref="[filesystem_error.members]"/>/7 refers to a non-existing
function <tt>path::native_string</tt>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns:</i> A string containing <tt>runtime_error::what()</tt>. The exact format is unspecified. Implementations
are encouraged but not required to include <tt>path1.native_string()</tt> if not empty, 
<tt>path2.native_string()</tt> if not empty, and <tt>system_error::what()</tt> strings in the returned string.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Existing implementations differ, as Jonathan also determined:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Boost.Filesystem uses <tt>path::string()</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>Libstdc++ uses <tt>path::string()</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>MSVC++/Dinkumware uses <tt>path::u8string()</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>It seems that libc++ doesn't include the paths in <tt>what()</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
We've had <tt>native_string()</tt> in the spec since <a href="http://wg21.link/n3239#filesystem_error-what">N3239</a> (where
it already didn't match any existing <tt>path</tt> function at that time).
<p/>
Before that it was <tt>file_string()</tt> in <a href="http://wg21.link/n1975#basic_filesystem_error-observers">N1975</a>
(within that specification <tt>path</tt> was a template that was parametrized in the character type).
<p/>
Since it can't be <tt>path::native()</tt> because that might be the wrong type, one of <tt>path::string()</tt> or 
<tt>path::u8string()</tt> seems appropriate.
<p/>
Albeit the wording is just a non-binding encouragement to implementations, the decision on this matter should not be
considered editorially due to the existing implementation variance. Any official resolution of the current state could
cause a reconsideration of existing implementations, and therefore it should be documented.

<note>2017-05-25, Jonathan comments and suggests an alternative resolution</note>
<p>
The revised wording changes leave it up to the implementation which of the native format observers to use. The 
"if not empty" seems redundant, because if the path is empty then there's nothing to include anyway, but the 
proposed resolution preserves it.
