<p>
The timed lockable and mutex requirements currently use "<tt>rel_time</tt> denotes an object of an 
instantiation of duration, and <tt>abs_time</tt> denotes an object of an instantiation of <tt>time_point</tt>" 
to define the variables used to specify the timed lock functions. During LWG review of 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p2160r0">P2160R0</a>, it was noted that this definition is deficient in two
aspects:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>It doesn't allow for <i>cv</i>-qualification of <tt>rel_time</tt> and <tt>abs_time</tt></p></li>
<li><p>For <tt>time_point</tt>s, it should require that the clock is a real <i>Cpp17Clock</i>. We impose 
that requirement via <sref ref="[thread.req.paramname]"/>, but there are no template parameters named 
<tt>Clock</tt> here.</p></li>
</ul>
