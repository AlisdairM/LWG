<p>The specification for <tt>adjacent_difference</tt> has baked-in sequential semantics, in order to support reading/writing 
through input/output iterators. There should a second specification more amenable to parallelization for the overloads taking 
an execution policy.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Provide a specification for the overloads taking an execution policy this is more clearly suitable for 
parallel execution. (i.e., one that does not refer to an accumulated state.)</p>

<p>
Anthony Williams's paper on parallel algorithm complexity, <a href="http://wg21.link/p0574r0">p0574r0</a>,
includes wording that would resolve LWG issue 2919, and I suggest we defer initial triage to handling that paper.
