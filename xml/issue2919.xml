<p>The specification for adjacent_difference has baked-in sequential semantics, in order to support reading/writing through input/output iterators. There should a second specification more amenable to parallelization for the overloads taking an execution policy.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Provide a specification for the overloads taking an execution policy this is more clearly suitable for parallel execution. (i.e., one that does not refer to an accumulated state.)</p>
