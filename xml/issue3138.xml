<title>There is no such thing as <i>assertion-level</i></title>

<p>
<tt>contract_violation</tt> has an <tt>assertion_level</tt> member 
function that is specified to return text "describing the <i>assertion-level</i>
of the violated contract". There is, however, no <i>assertion-level</i> in
<sref ref="[dcl.attr.contract]"/>, only <i>contract-level</i>.
<p/>
By itself, this can probably be handled editorially as a typo, but we may want to 
reconsider the name of the function, which currently mirrors the (incorrect) name 
of the nonterminal.
