<p>
When implementing C++23 new <tt>ranges::starts_with</tt> and <tt>ranges::ends_with</tt> 
<a href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/pull/1997">for MSVC</a> we came around some issues regarding infinite ranges.
<p/>
In short, there is no possible answers to <tt>ends_with</tt>, if the second range is infinite. Similarly, there 
is no meaningful answer to <tt>starts_with</tt> if both ranges are infinite.
<p/>
We should constraint both algorithms to forbid those corner cases (preferred resolution), or explicitly specify a 
given return value for those (The reasonable choice would be "<tt>return false;</tt>")
</p>
<note>2021-09-24 infinite ranges are invalid by [iterator.requirements.general] p10, so undefined by p12. Might be nice to relax this in future, but needs a paper. Status changed: New &rarr; NAD.</note>
