<sref ref="[thread.sharedtimedmutex.class]"/> paragraph 2: 
</p>
<blockquote><p> The class <tt>shared_timed_mutex</tt> shall satisfy all of the 
<tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> requirements (30.4.1.4). It shall be a standard layout class (Clause 9).
</p></blockquote> 
<p>
There's no <tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> requirements; this name doesn't appear anywhere else in the standard. (Prior to N3891, 
this was <tt>SharedMutex</tt>, which was equally undefined.)
<p/>
I assume this concept should be defined somewhere?
<p/>
Also, n3891 changes <sref ref="[thread.sharedtimedmutex.requirements]"/> from defining "shared mutex type" to defining 
"shared timed mutex type", but its paragraph 2 still talks about "shared mutex type". Is that OK? I think you could argue 
that it's clear enough what it means, but presumably it should use the term that paragraph 1 defined.
<p/>
<sref ref="[thread.lock.shared]"/> paragraph 1 talks about the "shared mutex requirements", which again is a term that isn't 
defined, and presumably means "the requirements on a shared timed mutex type" or similar (maybe if <tt>SharedMutex</tt> or 
<tt>SharedTimedMutex</tt> were defined it could be reused here).
