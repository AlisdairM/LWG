Unless described below, all operations have the same requirements and semantics as the primary `vector` template, 
except that operations dealing with the `bool` value type map to bit values in the container storage and 
`allocator_traits::construct` (<sref ref="[allocator.traits.members]"/>) is not used to construct these values.

<p>
Is <tt>vector&lt;bool, allocator&lt;int&gt;&gt;</tt> forbidden? There's implementation divergence: 
MSVC's STL enforces the mandate, while libc++ and libstdc++ accept this code, discovered while 
running libc++'s tests with MSVC's STL.
<p/>
Preferred resolution: I would be satisfied with resolving this as NAD, with a record that LWG believes 
that "all operations have the same requirements" means that the <i>Mandate</i> applies. I suppose that 
an editorial note could also be added to this effect, although I don't believe it's necessary.
<p/>
Alternate resolution: If LWG believes that the <i>Mandate</i> does not apply, and that <tt>vector&lt;bool&gt;</tt> 
should be unique among containers in accepting <tt>allocator&lt;Anything&gt;</tt>, then I believe that 
a normative sentence should be added to <sref ref="[vector.bool.pspc]"/>/2, specifically creating an exemption 
to <sref ref="[container.alloc.reqmts]"/>/5.
