<p>
The private members of <tt>node_handle</tt> are missing the usual "exposition only" comment. As a consequence, 
<tt>ptr_</tt> and <tt>alloc_</tt> now appear to be names defined by the library (so programs defining these names 
as macros before including a library header have undefined behavior).
<p/>
Presumably this is unintentional and these members should be considered to be for exposition only.
<p/>
It's also not clear whether the name <tt>node_handle</tt> is reserved for library usage or not; 
<sref ref="[container.node.overview]"/>/3 says the implementation need not provide a type with this name, but 
doesn't seem to rule out the possibility that an implementation will choose to do so regardless.

A similar problem seems to exist for the exposition-only type <tt><i>call_wrapper</i></tt> from 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0358r1">p0358r1</a>, which exposes a private data member named <tt>fd</tt> and 
a typedef <tt>FD</tt>.
