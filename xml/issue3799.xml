<p>
See also LWG <iref ref="3782"/>. Like <tt>lerp</tt>, neither <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt> nor C compatibility is mentioned in 
<paper num="P0030R1"/>, and MSVC STL decides not to declare 3-argument <tt>hypot</tt> overloads in the global namespace 
(perhaps so does libc++).
<p/>
Perhaps we should also avoid providing these overloads in the global namespace. However, such change seems a bit 
difficult for libstdc++'s <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt>.
