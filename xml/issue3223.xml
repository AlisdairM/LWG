<p>
It seems that <tt>lerp</tt> can't give a sensible answer for integer inputs. It's new machinery, 
not the legacy C stuff extended with extra overloads.
<p/>
I would prefer to fix this by explicitly annotating the functions that are supposed to get additional 
overloads because we keep getting this wrong, but we could also exempt <tt>lerp</tt> in 
<sref ref="[cmath.syn]"/> p2.
