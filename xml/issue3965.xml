<p>
The C++23 DIS contains the following example in <sref ref="[format.string.escaped]"/> p3. (This example does 
not appear in the most recent <paper num="N4950"/> WP or on <a href="https://eel.is/c++draft">https://eel.is/c++draft</a> 
because the project editor has not yet merged changes needed to support rendering of some of the characters involved).
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
string s6 = format("[{:?}]", "&#x1F937;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;"); // s6 has value: ["&#x1F937;\u{200d}&#x2642;\u{fe0f}"]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The character to be formatted (&#x1F937;&#x200D;&#x2642;&#xFE0F;) consists of the following sequence of code points 
in the order presented:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>U+1F937 (SHRUG)</p></li>
<li><p>U+200D (ZERO WIDTH JOINER)</p></li>
<li><p>U+2642 (MALE SIGN)</p></li>
<li><p>U+FE0F (VARIATION SELECTOR-16)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
<sref ref="[format.string.escaped]"/> bullet 2.2.1 specifies which code points are to be formatted as a 
<tt>\u{<i>hex-digit-sequence</i>}</tt> escape sequence:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(2.2.1) &mdash; If <i>X</i> encodes a single character <i>C</i>, then:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(2.2.1.1) &mdash; If <i>C</i> is one of the characters in Table 75 [tab:format.escape.sequences], then the two characters shown 
as the corresponding escape sequence are appended to <i>E</i>.</p></li>
<li><p>(2.2.1.2) &mdash; Otherwise, if <i>C</i> is not U+0020 SPACE and</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li><p>(2.2.1.2.1) &mdash; <i>CE</i> is UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 and <i>C</i> corresponds to a Unicode scalar value whose
Unicode property <tt>General_Category</tt> has a value in the groups <tt>Separator</tt> (<tt>Z</tt>) or <tt>Other</tt>
(<tt>C</tt>), as described by UAX #44 of the Unicode Standard, or</p></li>
<li><p>(2.2.1.2.2) &mdash; <i>CE</i> is UTF-8, UTF-16, or UTF-32 and <i>C</i> corresponds to a Unicode scalar value with
the Unicode property <tt>Grapheme_Extend=Yes</tt> as described by UAX #44 of the Unicode
Standard and <i>C</i> is not immediately preceded in <i>S</i> by a character <i>P</i> appended to <i>E</i> without
translation to an escape sequence, or</p></li>
<li><p>(2.2.1.2.3) &mdash; <i>CE</i> is neither UTF-8, UTF-16, nor UTF-32 and <i>C</i> is one of an implementation-defined
set of separator or non-printable characters</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
then the sequence <tt>\u{<i>hex-digit-sequence</i>}</tt> is appended to <i>E</i>, where <tt><i>hex-digit-sequence</i></tt>
is the shortest hexadecimal representation of <i>C</i> using lower-case hexadecimal digits.
</p>
</li>
<li><p>(2.2.1.3) &mdash; Otherwise, <i>C</i> is appended to <i>E</i>.</p></li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
The example is not consistent with the above specification for the final code point. 
<a href="https://util.unicode.org/UnicodeJsps/character.jsp?a=FE0F">U+FE0F</a> is a single character, 
is not one of the characters in Table 75, is not U+0020, has a <tt>General_Category</tt> of <tt>Nonspacing Mark (Mn)</tt> 
which is neither <tt>Z</tt> nor <tt>C</tt>, has <tt>Grapheme_Extend=Yes</tt> but the prior character (U+2642) is not 
formatted as an escape sequence, and is not one of an implementation-defined set of separator or non-printable characters 
(for the purposes of this example; the example assumes a UTF-8 encoding). Thus, formatting for this character falls to 
the last bullet point and the character should be appended as is (without translation to an escape sequence). 
Since this character is a combining character, it should  combine with the previous character and thus alter the 
appearance of U+2642 (thus producing <tt>"&#x2642;&#xFE0F;"</tt> instead of <tt>"&#x2642;\u{fe0f}"</tt>).
