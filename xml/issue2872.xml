<p>The term 'direct non-list initialization' needs to be
incorporated from the Library Fundamentals TS, as
several components added to C++17 rely on this
definition.</p>

<p>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
Add:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
17.3.X direct-non-list-initialization [defns.direct-non-list-init]
<p/>
A direct-initialization that is not list-initialization.
</p>
