<p>
Table 102 in <sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/>/8 states on expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> that it 
"returns the comparison object out of which a was constructed". At the same time, 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/8 states (starting in the third line) that 
"...Any <tt>Compare</tt>, <tt>Pred</tt>, or <tt>Hash</tt> objects belonging to <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> 
shall be swappable and <em>shall be exchanged</em> by unqualified calls to non-member swap...". This is 
problematic for any compliant implementation, since once swapped the container cannot return the comparison 
object out of which it was constructed unless incurring in storing an otherwise needless object.
<p/>
The simple solution is to correct that statement in Table 102, but I believe this is part of a larger problem 
of underspecified behavior: The new standard has made an effort in regards to allocators and now fully 
specifies what happens to stateful allocator objects. It has even specified what happens to stateful <tt>hasher</tt> 
and <tt>key_equal</tt> members of unordered containers (they propagate), but it says nothing about stateful 
comparison objects of (ordered) associative containers, except for the statement in 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/8 referred above and only related to <tt>swap</tt>.
<p/>
For example, it is unclear to me what is specified to happen on an assignment: should the comparison object 
be copied/moved along with the elements, or should the left-hand side object keep its own?
Maybe this has been intentionally left unspecified with the purpose of compatibility with C++98, which I 
understand it specified that comparison objects were kept for the entire life of the container (like allocators) 
&mdash; an unfortunate choice. But anyway, the segment of <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> quoted 
above seems to break any possible backwards compatibility with C++98 in this regard.
<p/>
Therefore, taking into consideration consistency with how this is dealed with for unordered associative 
containers, I propose that Table 102 is modified as follows:
</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
The row for expression <tt>a.key_comp()</tt> is changed so that its "assertion/note pre-/post-condition" reads 
"Returns <tt>a</tt>'s comparison object."
</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>
A new row is added at the appropriate location (which I believe would be after "X(il)" row), with:
</p>

<blockquote>
<table border="1">

<p>
STL: can't believe we don't specify this already. this is totally necessary
<p/>
Alisdair: how does it do this? copy construction? assignment?
<p/>
Also need it for move.
<p/>
STL: we already specify this for constructing from a comparator, not during copy construction though.
<p/>
Jonathan: don't like wording, should say "<tt>key_compare</tt> is <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>. Uses <tt>b.key_comp()</tt> 
as a comparison object."
<p/>
STL: we get it right for unordered!
<p/>
Jonathan: can't wordsmith this now, but I think implementations do the right thing.
<p/>
Alisdair: not sure what right thing is for moves. Also we say nothing about propagating allocators to functors.
</p>
<p>
Moved to Open.
</p>

<note>2015-02 Cologne</note>
<p>
TK: There's no need for fine-grained propagate/not-propagate control. If you don't want to propagate the predicate, you can 
simply construct or insert from an iterator range.
<p/>
VV: libstdc++ already implements the resolution of this issue.
<p/>
GR: There are a couple of other problems. We don't specify move constructor and move assignment for maps. Those are just general.
<p/>
TK: General container requirements already describe the semantics for {copy,move}-{construction,assignment}, so it doesn't 
seem that there's room for choice in <tt>std::map</tt> assignments. <tt>unordered_map</tt> is different, though.
<p/>
[Note: Check what general container requirements say about container equality.]
<p/>
DK will draft wording. The decision is to unambiguously make all {copy,move}-{construction,assignment} operations endow the 
LHS with the exact state of the RHS, including all predicates and hash function states.
<p/>
Conclusion: Update wording, revisit later.

<note>2015-10-19 Daniel comments and provides alternative wording</note>
<p>
The current standard is especially unclear in regard to what effects move operations of unordered/associative
containers should have. We have one example that is standardized exactly in this way by looking at 
<sref ref="[priqueue.cons.alloc]"/> p7:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template &lt;class Alloc&gt; priority_queue(priority_queue&amp;&amp; q, const Alloc&amp; a);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-7- <i>Effects</i>: Initializes <tt>c</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.c)</tt> as the first argument and <tt>a</tt> as 
the second argument, and initializes <tt>comp</tt> with <tt>std::move(q.comp)</tt>
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
A similarly comparable example are the move-operations of <tt>std::unique_ptr</tt> in regard to the deleter 
(when this is no a reference), which also respect move-capabilities of that function object.
<p/>
We have wording from C++98 for associative containers (but <em>not</em> for unordered containers!) that was never
adjusted to C++11 move-semantics in <sref ref="[associative.reqmts]"/> p12:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
When an associative container is constructed by passing a comparison object the container shall not store
a pointer or reference to the passed object, even if that object is passed by reference. When an associative
container is copied, either through a copy constructor or an assignment operator, the target container shall
then use the comparison object from the container being copied, as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The second sentence of this wording is problematic for several reasons:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>It only talks about copy operations, not about move operations, except that the term "assignment" without
leading "copy" is a bit ambigious (albeit it seems clear in the complete context).</p></li>
<li><p>It is not really clear how to interpret "as if that comparison object had been
passed to the target container in its constructor" for an assignment operation. A possible but not conclusive
interpretation could be that this is wording supporting a "copy-via-swap" idiom.</p></li>
<li><p>There does not exist similar wording for unordered containers, except that Table 102 provides entries for
copy construction and copy assignment of the containers whose wording just talks of "copies" in either case.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Existing implementations differ already:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Visual Studio 2015 uses copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations but uses swap operations
for the move operations.</p></li>
<li><p>GCC's libstdc++ performs copy construction and copy assignment for the two copy operations and for the two
move operations, respectively</p></li>
<li><p>clang++'s libc++ performs copy/move construction and copy/move assignment for the corresponding
four copy/move operations</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
The alternative wording provided below attempts to clarify that container copy/move operations perform the corresponding
copy/move operations on the owned function objects.
