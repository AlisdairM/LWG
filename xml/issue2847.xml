<p>
With <a href="https://wg21.link/p0175r1">P0175R1</a>, we now show in [cmath.syn] three overloads for
the <tt>sin</tt> function: One taking a <tt>float</tt>, one taking a <tt>double</tt>,
and one taking a <tt>long double</tt>. However, there is no statement that <tt>sin(long double)</tt> 
should actually invoke <tt>sinl</tt>, presumably delivering extra precision.
<p/>
An implementation like
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
inline long double sin(long double x)
{ return sinf(x); }
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
seems to satisfy the "effectively cast" requirement, but is certainly unintentional.
<p/>
The same issue arises for all math functions inherited from C.
