<title>The primary template of <tt>std::char_traits</tt> is totally underspecified</title>

<p>
Currently, only explicit specializations of <tt>std::char_traits</tt> are specified in the standard. 
Nothing is specified for the primary template except that it's not marked "not defined".
<p/>
Given some implementations provide the definition of the primary template (perhaps as an extension), 
it might be better to explicitly say that instantiation of the primary template has unspecified effect.
Also, it seems outdated to say "explicit specializations" as partial specializations are possible 
since C++20.

Set priority to 4 after reflector poll.

<p>
<sref ref="[char.traits.general]"/>/1 says that the subclause
"defines a class template <code>char_traits&lt;charT&gt;</code>",
but we never provided a definition.
</p>
<p>
"Libc++ started to warn that the primary template is deprecated and will
be removed. The proposed resolution doesn't improve matters though."
</p>
<p>
"The definition should be cross-platform. Unspecified doesn't help."

<blockquote><pre>
template&lt;class charT&gt; struct char_traits;

<p>
is provided in the header <tt>&lt;string&gt;</tt> as a basis for explicit <ins>and partial</ins>
