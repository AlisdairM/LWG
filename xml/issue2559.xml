<p>
The resolution of LWG <iref ref="2234"/> says that <tt>assert(E)</tt> is a constant subexpression if "<tt>NDEBUG</tt> is defined 
at the point where <tt>assert(E)</tt> appears".
<p/>
This is incorrect, as noted in one of STL's comments in that issue's discussion, but was apparently overlooked.
<p/>
The proposed resolution below just borrows STL's phrasing from the discussion.
