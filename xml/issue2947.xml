<p>
During the application of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0430r2">P0430R2</a>, we came across several terms that seem insufficiently 
clear and lacking proper definitions.
<p/>
We would like clarification on what those terms mean, and we would welcome wording suggestions, or alternatively a verbose explanation and dispensation to change the presentation editorially.
<p/>
The items in question are:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What does it mean to 'always interpret [the character sequence] in the same way'? ([fs.enum.path.format], which is 
[path.format] in the paper)</p></li>
<li><p>What is a "directory-like" file type? ([fs.class.directory_iterator])</p></li>
<li><p>What is an "implementation-defined file type"? (e.g. [fs.op.copy])</p></li>
</ul>
