<title>unique, associative <tt>emplace()</tt> should not move/copy the <tt>mapped_type</tt> constructor arguments when no insertion happens</title>

<p>
<tt>a_uniq.emplace(args)</tt> is specified as:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
<i>Effects</i>: Inserts a value_type object <tt>t</tt> constructed with<br/>
<tt>std::forward&lt;Args&gt;(args)...</tt> if and only if there is no element in the<br/>
container with key equivalent to the key of <tt>t</tt>. The <tt>bool</tt> component of<br/>
the returned pair is true if and only if the insertion takes place,<br/>
and the iterator component of the pair points to the element with key<br/>
equivalent to the key of <tt>t</tt>. 
</p></blockquote>

<p>
However, we occasionally find code of the form:
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
std::unique_ptr&lt;Foo&gt; p(new Foo);
auto res = m.emplace("foo", std::move(p));
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
where we'd like to avoid destroying the <tt>Foo</tt> if the insertion doesn't
take place (if the container already had an element with the specified key).
<p/>
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2014/n3873">N3873</a> includes
a partial solution to this in the form of a new <tt>emplace_stable</tt> member function, but LEWG's 
discussion strongly agreed that we'd rather have <tt>emplace()</tt> Just Work:
<p/>
Should <tt>map::emplace()</tt> be guaranteed not to move/copy its arguments if the insertion doesn't happen?
<p/>
SF: 8 F: 3 N: 0 A: 0 SA: 0
<p/>
This poll was marred by the fact that we didn't notice or call out
that <tt>emplace()</tt> must construct the key before doing the lookup, and it
must not then move the key after it determines whether an insert is
going to happen, and the <tt>mapped_type</tt> instance must live next to the key.
<p/>
The very similar issue <iref ref="2006"/> was previously marked NAD, with
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3178.htm">N3178</a> as
discussion. However, given LEWG's interest in the alternate behavior,
I think we should reopen the issue or open a new one with a better
title.
<p/>
We will need a paper that describes how to implement this before we can make more progress.
