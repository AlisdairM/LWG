<title>is [iterator.requirements.general]/9 too broadly applied?</title>

<sref ref="[iterator.requirements.general]"/> p9 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Destruction of an iterator may invalidate pointers and references previously obtained from that iterator.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But the resolution of LWG issue <iref ref="2360"/> specifically advocates returning <tt>*--temp;</tt> where <tt>temp</tt> is a 
local variable.
<p/>
And <sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/> p6 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> are both dereferenceable, then <tt>a == b</tt> if and only if <tt>*a</tt> and <tt>*b</tt> are bound 
to the same object.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
which disallows "stashing" iterators (i.e, iterators that refer to data inside themselves).
<p/>
So, I suspect that the restriction in p9 should only apply to input iterators, and can probably be moved into 
<sref ref="[input.iterators]"/> instead of <sref ref="[iterator.requirements.general]"/>.
