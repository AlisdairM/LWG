<p>
In [cmplx.over] and [cmath.syn], when talking about "sufficient additional overloads", we use the phrase
"effectively cast", but that is not a defined term.
<p/>
A hostile interpretation could read "<tt>reinterpret_cast</tt>" here.
<p/>
Likely we mean "apply floating-point promotions, floating-integral
conversions, and floating-point conversions", but that should be
spelled out somewhere, e.g. in the library definitions section.
