As pointed out by <a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg10/2022/07/0829.php">Casey Carter</a>, 
four papers approved at the recent July 2022 plenary:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><paper num="P2419R2"/> "Clarify handling of encodings in localized formatting of chrono
types"</p></li>
<li><p><paper num="P2508R1"/> "Expose <tt>std::basic-format-string&lt;charT, Args...&gt;</tt>"</p></li>
<li><p><paper num="P2286R8"/> "Formatting Ranges"</p></li>
<li><p><paper num="P2585R1"/> "Improve container default formatting"</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
all bump the value of <tt>__cpp_lib_format</tt>. We never accounted for all of these papers 
being moved at the same time, and these papers have fairly different implementation complexities. 
<p/>
<a href="https://lists.isocpp.org/sg10/2022/07/0832.php">Victor Zverovich</a> suggests that we 
instead add <tt>__cpp_lib_format_ranges</tt> (with value <tt>202207L</tt>) for the two formatting 
ranges papers (<paper num="P2286"/> and <paper num="P2585"/>, which should probably be implemented 
concurrently anyway, since the latter modifies the former) and <tt>bump __cpp_lib_format</tt> for 
the other two, which are both minor changes.
<p/>
We should do that.
