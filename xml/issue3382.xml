<p>
We had <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/235">this NB ballot issue</a>, to ensure that 
<tt>std::array</tt> could be a NTTP. But after <a href="http://wg21.link/p1907">P1907</a>, we still need 
some kind of wording to ensure that <tt>std::array</tt> (and also <tt>std::pair</tt>) have no extra 
private members or base classes.
<p/>
This is similar to LWG <iref ref="3373"/> &mdash; maybe we just need to add:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class template <tt>pair</tt>/<tt>array</tt> has the data members specified above. It has no base 
classes or data members other than those specified.
</p></blockquote>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4849">N4849</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[pairs.pair]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- Constructors and member functions of <tt>pair</tt> do not throw exceptions unless one of the element-wise 
operations specified to be called for that operation throws an exception.
<p/>
-2- The defaulted move and copy constructor, respectively, of <tt>pair</tt> is a constexpr function if and 
only if all required element-wise initializations for copy and move, respectively, would satisfy the 
requirements for a constexpr function.
<p/>
-3- If <tt>(is_trivially_destructible_v&lt;T1&gt; &amp;&amp; is_trivially_destructible_v&lt;T2&gt;)</tt> 
is <tt>true</tt>, then the destructor of <tt>pair</tt> is trivial.
<p/>
<ins>-?- The class template <tt>pair</tt> has the data members specified above. It has no base classes or 
data members other than those specified.</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>

<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[array.overview]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- The header <tt>&lt;array&gt;</tt> defines a class template for storing fixed-size sequences of objects. 
An <tt>array</tt> is a contiguous container (<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>). An instance of 
<tt>array&lt;T, N&gt;</tt> stores <tt>N</tt> elements of type <tt>T</tt>, so that <tt>size() == N</tt> is 
an invariant.
<p/>
-2- An <tt>array</tt> is an aggregate (<sref ref="[dcl.init.aggr]"/>) that can be list-initialized with up 
to <tt>N</tt> elements whose types are convertible to <tt>T</tt>.
<p/>
-3- An <tt>array</tt> meets all of the requirements of a container and of a reversible container 
(<sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>), except that a default constructed <tt>array</tt> object is not empty 
and that <tt>swap</tt> does not have constant complexity. An <tt>array</tt> meets some of the requirements 
of a sequence container (<sref ref="[sequence.reqmts]"/>). Descriptions are provided here only for
operations on <tt>array</tt> that are not described in one of these tables and for operations where there 
is additional semantic information.
<p/>
<ins>-?- The class template <tt>array</tt> has the data members specified in subclauses 
<sref ref="[array.overview]"/> and <sref ref="[array.zero]"/>. It has no base classes or 
data members other than those specified.</ins>
<p/>
