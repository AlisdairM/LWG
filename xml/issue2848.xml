<p>
<sref ref="[mem.res.pool.options]"/> p3 talks about a "pass-through-threshold".
<p/>
First, the phrase is not defined and it seems it could be easily avoided given the context.
<p/>
Second, given the phrasing here, it seems the implementation is essentially allowed to 
ignore the value <tt>largest_required_pool_block</tt> as it sees fit. It is unclear whether 
that is the intention.
