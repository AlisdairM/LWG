<p>
<paper num="P0433R2"/>, the proposal for adding deduction guides to the standard library, contained a 
recommendation to use <tt>__cpp_lib_deduction_guides</tt> as a feature test macro. However, it appears that this feature test macro has been accidentally omitted from the Standard when the paper was applied and probably needs to be added back.

<note>2021-11-16; Konstantin Varlamov comments and improves wording</note>
<p>
One potential topic of discussion is whether the new feature test macro needs to be defined in every library 
header that contains an explicit deduction guide. While this would be consistent with the current approach, 
no other macro is associated with such a large set of headers (20 headers in total, whereas the current 
record-holder is <tt>__cpp_lib_nonmember_container_access</tt> with 12 headers). For this reason, it should 
be considered whether perhaps the new macro should only be defined in <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> (which would, 
however, make it an outlier). The proposed wording currently contains an exhaustive list (note that the 
deduction guides for <tt>&lt;mutex&gt;</tt> were removed by LWG <iref ref="2981"/>).
