See <a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=38504">this reflector discussion</a>
for background.
<p/>
<sref ref="[iterator.requirements]"/> attempts to establish requirements for iterators,
but <sref ref="[iterator.traits]"/>/1 establishes further requirements that must be met
in order to author a portable iterator that works with existing implementations.
Failing to meet the requirements of the latter will fail to work in practice.
The former requirements should reference the latter, normatively.
