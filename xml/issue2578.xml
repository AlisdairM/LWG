See <a href="http://accu.org/cgi-bin/wg21/message?wg=lib&amp;msg=38504">this reflector discussion</a>
for background.
<p/>
<sref ref="[iterator.requirements]"/> attempts to establish requirements for iterators,
but <sref ref="[iterator.traits]"/>/1 establishes further requirements that must be met
in order to author a portable iterator that works with existing implementations.
Failing to meet the requirements of the latter will fail to work in practice.
The former requirements should reference the latter, normatively.

<resolution>
After [iterator.requirements.general]/5, insert the following new paragraph:

<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>
-?- In addition to the requirements in this sub-clause, the nested <em>typedef-name</em>s specified
in ([iterator.traits]) shall be provided for the iterator type. [<i>Note:</i>
Either the iterator type must provide the <em>typedef-name</em>s directly (in which
case iterator_traits pick them up automatically), or an iterator_traits
specialization must provide them. <i>-end note</i>]
</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
</resolution>
