<p>
This modification will allow complex-number arithmetic to be performed at compile time. From a mathematical 
standpoint, it is natural (and desirable) to treat complex numbers on the same footing as the reals. 
From a programming perspective, this change will broaden the scope in which <tt>std::complex</tt> can be used, 
allowing it to be smoothly incorporated into classes exploiting <tt>constexpr</tt>.
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
The following functions in the <tt>std::complex</tt> namespace should be made <tt>constexpr</tt>:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Section <sref ref="[complex.member.ops]"/>: The member (arithmetic) operators 
{<tt>+=</tt>, <tt>-=</tt>, <tt>/=</tt>, <tt>*=</tt>}
</p></li>
<li><p>
Section <sref ref="[complex.ops]"/>: The arithmetic operators unary operators {<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>} 
and binary operators {<tt>+</tt>, <tt>-</tt>, <tt>/</tt>, <tt>*</tt>};
</p></li>
<li><p>
Section <sref ref="[complex.value.ops]"/>: The 'value' operators <tt>abs</tt>, <tt>norm</tt>, and <tt>conj</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In terms of modification of the standard, all that is required is the insertion of the <tt>constexpr</tt> specifier 
in the relevant parts of:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Section <sref ref="[complex.syn]"/> (the Header synopsis), together with the corresponding entries in sections 
<sref ref="[complex.ops]"/> and <sref ref="[complex.value.ops]"/>.
</p></li>
<li><p>
Sections <sref ref="[complex]"/>, <sref ref="[complex.special]"/> (class template and specializations), together 
with the corresponding entries in section <sref ref="[complex.member.ops]"/>.
</p></li>
</ol>

<note>2016-05 Issues Telecon</note>
<p>
This kind of work (new feature) has been being done via papers rather than via the issues list.
</p>
<p>
Walter believes that he knows someone who would be willing to write such a paper.
