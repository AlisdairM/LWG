<p>
The alias template <tt>std::experimental::resource_adaptor</tt> is an important
part of the polymorphic memory resources framework, but was not
adopted into the WP along with the rest of LFTSv1. This seems to be an
accidental omission. It was present in P0220R0, but absent in P0220R1.
There was no discussion of leaving it out in Jacksonville, it is one
of the "core features" discussed and intended for adoption.
