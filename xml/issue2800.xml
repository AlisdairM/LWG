<p/>
<tt>swap</tt> is a critical function in the standard library, and 
should be declared <tt>constexpr</tt> to support more 
widespread support for <tt>constexpr</tt> in libraries. This 
was proposed in <a href="http://wg21.link/p0202r1">P0202R1</a> which was reviewed 
favourably at Oulu, but the widespread changes to 
the <tt>&lt;algorithm&gt;</tt> header were too risky and unproven 
for C++17. We should not lose <tt>constexpr</tt> support for 
the much simpler (and more important) <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt> 
functions because they were attached to a larger 
paper. Similarly, the fundamental value wrappers, <tt>pair</tt> and <tt>tuple</tt>,
should have <tt>constexpr swap</tt> functions, 
and the same should be considered for <tt>optional</tt> and 
<tt>variant</tt>. It is not possible to mark <tt>swap</tt> for <tt>std::array</tt>
as <tt>constexpr</tt> without adopting the rest of the 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0202r1">P0202R1</a> though, or rewriting the specification 
for array swap to not use <tt>swap_ranges</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Adopt the changes to the <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt> header proposed in 
<a href="http://wg21.link/p0202r1">P0202R1</a>, i.e., only bullets C, D, and E.
In addition, mark the <tt>swap</tt> functions of <tt>pair</tt> and 
<tt>tuple</tt> as <tt>constexpr</tt>, and consider doing the same for 
<tt>optional</tt> and <tt>variant</tt>.
