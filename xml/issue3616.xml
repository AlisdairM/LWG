<p>
LWG <iref ref="3498"/> fixes the inconsistent <tt>noexcept</tt>-specifiers for member functions of <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt>, 
but the proposed resolution in LWG <iref ref="3498"/> seems to miss the non-member <tt>swap</tt>, which also has 
inconsistent <tt>noexcept</tt>-specifier: <sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.special]"/> says it's <tt>noexcept</tt>, 
while <sref ref="[syncstream.syn]"/> says it's not.
<p/>
Since the non-member <tt>swap</tt> and the member <tt>swap</tt> have equivalent effect, and LWG 3498 removes 
<tt>noexcept</tt> from the latter, I think it's pretty clear that the former should not be <tt>noexcept</tt>.
