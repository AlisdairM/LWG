<p>
These functions are specified to call <tt>emit()</tt>, which calls <tt>emit()</tt> on
the <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt> and sets <tt>badbit</tt> if it fails. Then, the move
assignment is specified to move-assign the <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt>, while the destructor 
implicitly needs to destroy the <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt> data member. This calls <tt>emit()</tt> 
on the <tt>basic_syncbuf</tt> again.
<p/>
Is this intended?
