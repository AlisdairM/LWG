<p>There is no ability to supply an allocator for the control block when constructing a shared_ptr from a unique_ptr. Note that no further shared_ptr constructors need an allocator, as they all have pre-existing control blocks that are shared, or already have the allocator overload.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Add an additional shared_ptr constructor, <tt>template &lt;class Y, class D, class A&gt; shared_ptr(unique_ptr&lt;Y, D&gt;&amp;&amp; r, A alloc)</tt>, with the same semantics as the existing constructor taking a unique_ptr, but using the alloc argument to supply memory as required.</p>
