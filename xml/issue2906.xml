<p>There is no ability to supply an allocator for the control block when constructing a <tt>shared_ptr</tt> from a <tt>unique_ptr</tt>. 
Note that no further <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructors need an allocator, as they all have pre-existing control blocks that are shared, 
or already have the allocator overload.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Add an additional <tt>shared_ptr</tt> constructor, 
<tt>template &lt;class Y, class D, class A&gt; shared_ptr(unique_ptr&lt;Y, D&gt;&amp;&amp; r, A alloc)</tt>, with the same semantics 
as the existing constructor taking a <tt>unique_ptr</tt>, but using the <tt>alloc</tt> argument to supply memory as required.</p>
