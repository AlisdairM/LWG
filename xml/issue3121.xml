<p>
Currently the <tt>tuple</tt> constructors of the form:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class... UTypes&gt;
<i>EXPLICIT</i> constexpr tuple(UTypes&amp;&amp;...);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
are not properly constrained in that in the 1-element <tt>tuple</tt> case, the constraints do no short-circuit when 
the constructor would be (incorrectly) considered as a possible copy/move constructor candidate. libc++ has a 
workaround for this, but the additional short-circuiting does not actually appear in the working draft.
<p/>
As an example of why this lack of short circuiting is a problem in practice, consider the following line:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
bool a = std::is_copy_constructible_v&lt;std::tuple&lt;any&gt;&gt;;
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The above code will cause a compile error because of a recursive trait definition. The copy constructibility 
check implies doing substitution into the <tt>UTypes&amp;&amp;...</tt> constructor overloads, which in turn 
will check if <tt>tuple&lt;any&gt;</tt> is convertible to any, which in turn will check if <tt>tuple&lt;any&gt;</tt> 
is copy constructible (and so the trait is dependent on itself).
<p/>
I do not provide wording for the proposed fix in anticipation of requires clauses potentially changing how we 
do the specification, however, the basic solution should be similar to what we've done for other standard library 
types, which is to say that the very first constraint should be to check that if <tt>sizeof...(UTypes) == 1</tt> 
and the type, after applying <tt>remove_cvref_t</tt>, is the <tt>tuple</tt> type itself, then we should force 
substitution failure rather than checking any further constraints.
