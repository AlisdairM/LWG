<p>
We added <tt>from_chars_result</tt> and <tt>to_chars_result</tt> into <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>, but those contain 
<tt>error_code</tt> instances, which come from <tt>&lt;system_error&gt;</tt>. This creates a circular dependency 
issue which is somewhat difficult to resolve, as <tt>error_code</tt> depends on <tt>error_category</tt> which has virtuals 
that return <tt>string</tt> &mdash; it would effectively force putting all of <tt>&lt;string&gt;</tt> into 
<tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
Since (I believe) nobody has implemented this yet, would there be support for changing the member of 
<tt>from_chars_result</tt> / <tt>to_chars_result</tt> to an <tt>errc</tt> instead of an <tt>error_code</tt> (as a 
fast-track DR against 17)?

The paper <a href="https://wg21.link/p0682r0">P0682R0</a> "Repairing elementary string conversions" is available 
in the pre-Toronto mailing and provides wording.
