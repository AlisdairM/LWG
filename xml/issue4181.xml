<title>Some ranges have negative `ssize`</title>

There exist range types `R` whose size is representable by neither `ptrdiff_t` nor 
<tt><i>make-signed-like-t</i>&lt;ranges::range_size_t&lt;R&gt;&gt;</tt>, specifically `views::iota(size_t(0), size_t(-1))`. 
It's unfortunate that `std::ssize` and `ranges::ssize` produce a negative size for such ranges even when their 
difference type is capable of representing their size (see <a href="https://www.godbolt.org/z/599z55Y4f">demo</a>). 
Perhaps the `ssize` overloads should return 
<tt>static_cast&lt;common_type_t&lt;ptrdiff_t, iter_difference_t&lt;decltype(<i>meow</i>.begin())&gt;&gt;&gt;(<i>meow</i>.size())</tt> 
instead when the argument <tt><i>meow</i></tt> models `range`?

"The behaviour for Ranges regressed due to LWG <iref ref="3403"/>.
It might have been a mistake to broaden the domain of `ranges::ssize` to match
that of `ranges::size`.  The latter includes some non-Range arguments to ease
the transition from `std::size`, but thjere was no existing body of pre-C++20
code calling `std::ssize` that needed a transition path."
