<p>
<tt>resize_file</tt> has this postcondition (after resolving late comment 42, see <a href="http://wg21.link/p0489r0">P0489R0</a>):
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Postcondition:</i> <tt>file_size(p) == new_size</tt>.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is impossible for an implementation to satisfy, due to the possibility of file system races. 
This is not actually a postcondition; rather, it is an effect that need no longer hold when the function returns.
