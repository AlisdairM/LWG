<p>
<tt>unique_copy()</tt>'s wording says that if it's given input-only and output-only iterators, it needs 
the input's value type to be copyable. This is correct, because in this case the algorithm must have a 
local element copy in order to detect duplicates.
<p/>
The wording also says that if it's given an <tt>InputIterator</tt> that's forward or stronger, the input's 
value type doesn't have to be copyable. This is also correct, because in this case the algorithm can reread 
the input in order to detect duplicates.
<p/>
Finally, the wording says that if it's given an input-only iterator with an <tt>OutputIterator</tt> that's 
forward or stronger, the input's value type doesn't have to be copyable. This is telling the algorithm to 
compare its input to its output in order to detect duplicates, but that isn't always possible! If the input 
and output have the same value type, then they can be compared (as long as <tt>*result = *first</tt> behaves 
sanely; see below). If they have different value types, then we can't compare them.
<p/>
This could be resolved by requiring heterogeneous value types to be comparable in this situation, but that 
would be extremely tricky to wordsmith (as it would challenge the concept of "group of equal elements" used 
by the Effects). It will be vastly simpler and more effective to extend the "local element copy" requirement 
to this scenario.
<p/>
Note that the input-only, output forward-or-stronger, identical value types scenario needs a bit of work too.  
We always require *result = *first to be "valid", but in this case we need to additionally require that the 
assignment actually transfers the value. (Otherwise, we'd be allowing an <tt>op=()</tt> that ignores <tt>*first</tt> 
and always sets <tt>*result</tt> to zero, or other unacceptable behavior.) This is just <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>.
<p/>
(What happens when <tt>unique_copy()</tt> is given a <tt>move_iterator</tt> is a separate issue.)
<p/>
To summarize:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
input forward+: no additional requirements
<p/>
input-only, output forward+, same value types: needs <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>
<p/>
input-only, output forward+, different value types: needs <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>
<p/>
input-only, output-only: needs <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> and <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>
