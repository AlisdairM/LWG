<p>
- Some Effects: were intended to include the "Equivalent to" phrasing where no or different words were used.  See examples in std::filesystem and throughout the library.
</p>
<p>
- The wording in [structure.specifications]/4 is incorrect and Effects: throughout the library which use (or were intended to use) the "Equivalent to" phrasing need to be checked to make sure they fit the intended wording.

<p>
The PR is fine; but bullet #1 in the report really should have a list of places to change.

<resolution>
<p>Change [structure.specifications]/4 as indicated:</p>

<p>
<blockquote>
"[...] if F has no Returns: element, a non-void return from F is specified by the <del>Returns: elements</del><ins>return statements</ins> in the code sequence."
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>Add two 'return' keywords to [string.access]:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
const charT& front() const;
charT& front();
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>7  <i>Requires:</i> <code>!empty()</code>.</p>
<p>8  <i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to <code><ins>return </ins>operator[](0)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>

<pre>
const charT& back() const;
charT& back();
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>9  <i>Requires:</i> <code>!empty()</code>.</p>
<p>10  <i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to <code><ins>return </ins>operator[](size() - 1)</code>.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

</resolution>
