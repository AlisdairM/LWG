<sref ref="[counted.iterator]"/>/3 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Two values <tt>i1</tt> and <tt>i2</tt> of types <tt>counted_iterator&lt;I1&gt;</tt> and
<tt>counted_iterator&lt;I2&gt;</tt> refer to elements of the same sequence if and
only if <tt>next(i1.base(), i1.count())</tt> and <tt>next(i2.base(), i2.count())</tt>
refer to the same (possibly past-the-end) element.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, some users of <tt>counted_iterator</tt> (such as <tt>take_view</tt>) don't guarantee that 
there are <tt>count()</tt> elements past <tt>base()</tt>. It seems that we need to rephrase this 
definition to account for such uses.
