<p>
See <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/4437">this editorial issue</a>.
<p/>
<sref ref="[unord.hash]"/> p5.4 ends with "shall not throw an exception unless <tt>hash&lt;Key&gt;</tt> 
is a program-defined specialization that depends on at least one program-defined type."
<p/>
This seems wrong, because <tt>hash&lt;optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;</tt> is not a program-defined specialization, 
but it might throw if <tt>hash&lt;T&gt;</tt> can throw. There are also other partial specializations 
of <tt>std::hash</tt> defined in the standard library but that depend on program-defined specializations 
and so can throw.

<note>2021-01-29; reflector prioritization</note>
Set priority to 3 following reflector discussions.
It was pointed out that this wording could be simplified if <iref ref="3513"/>
changes the definition of program-defined type.
