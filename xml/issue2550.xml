<p>
I believe, the wording of the complexity specification for the standard
unordered containers' <tt>clear()</tt> method should be changed from "Linear" to
"Linear in <tt>a.size()</tt>". As of <a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2015/n4527.pdf">N4527</a>, 
the change should be done in the Complexity column of row "<tt>a.clear()</tt>..." in "Table 102 &mdash; Unordered
associative container requirements" in section Unordered associative containers <sref ref="[unord.req]"/>.
<p/>
From the current formulation it is not very clear, whether the complexity is linear in the number of buckets, 
in the number of elements, or both. cppreference is also <a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/unordered_map/clear#Complexity">not very specific</a>: 
it mentions the size of the container without being explicit about what exactly the size is.
<p/>
The issue is inspired by a <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=67922">performance bug in libstdc++</a>.
The issue is related to LWG <iref ref="1175"/>.
