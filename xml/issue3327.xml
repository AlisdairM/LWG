<title>Format alignment specifiers vs. text direction</title>

<p>
<tt>std::format()</tt> alignment specifiers should be independent of text direction
The align specifiers for formatting standard integer and string types are expressed in
terms of "left" and "right". However, "left alignment" as currently defined in the 
<tt>format()</tt> specification might end up being right-aligned when the resulting 
string is displayed in a RTL or bidirectional locale. This ambiguity can be resolved 
by removing "left" and "right" and replacing with "start" and "end", without changing 
any existing implementation and without changing the intent of the feature.
<p/>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
In [tab:format.align]:
Forces the field to be <del>left-aligned within</del> <ins>aligned to the start of</ins>
the available space and Forces the field to be <del>right-aligned within</del> 
<ins>aligned to the end of</ins> the available space

</p>
<blockquote><p>
# GB225
<p/>
JG: SG16 approved this.
<p/>
JG: If you scroll back up, you'll see see it's very tiny. Two line change.
<p/>
JG: I'm willing to submit an LWG issue to suggest we make a wording change to take it off our plate.
<p/>
CC: Is this the one that changes left/right to beginning/end?
<p/>
Some people: yes
<p/>
MC: Any problem with Jeff's proposed direction and this proposed fix?
<p/>
MC: I hear none.
