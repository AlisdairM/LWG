<discussion>
<p>
To ensure that <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> can be used in structural bindings,
it needs the special wording we use to negate the general library permission
to add private data members.
</p>
</discussion>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4842">N4842</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Add a paragraph at the end of <sref ref="[format.syn]"/> as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- The class template <tt>format_to_n_result</tt> has the template parameters,
data members, and special members specified above. It has no base classes or
members other than those specified.
</p>
