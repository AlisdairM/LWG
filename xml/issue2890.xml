<b>Addresses GB 30</b>

<p>The definition of 'object state' applies only to class types, implying that fundamental types and arrays do not have this 
property.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Replacing "an object state" with "a value of an object" in <sref ref="[defns.valid]"/> and dropping the 
definition of "object state" in <sref ref="[defns.obj.state]"/>.</p>
