<p>
What do the store and load operations intend to mean in this context? If there is no extra specification, 
it is easy to consider them as the operations performed by the non-static member functions "store" and "load" 
defined in the <tt>atomic</tt> class (template).

<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
An atomic operation <i>A</i> that performs a release operation on an atomic object <i>M</i> synchronizes with 
an atomic operation <i>B</i> that performs an acquire operation on <i>M</i> and takes its value from any side 
effect in the release sequence headed by <i>A</i>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
According to the above interpretation, <i>A</i> is an operation performed by the non-static member function 
<tt>store</tt>, however, I think the following example can establish the synchronization relationship
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x{0};

Thread 1:
int expected = 0;
x.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 1, memory_order::release, memory_order::relaxed); // #1

Thread 2:
int expected = 1;
while(x.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 2, memory_order::acquire, memory_order::relaxed)){} // #2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Assuming the RMW operations are successful in the two threads, I think <tt>#1</tt> intends to perform a 
release operation while <tt>#2</tt> performs an acquire operation, and hence they can establish the 
synchronization relationship, however, they both are RMW operations.
<p/>
It should be clearly defined which are store operations and which are load operations.

Set priority to 3 after reflector poll in November 2023. Ask SG1 to look.

Jonathan:
"Interpreting this to only mean the <code>store</code> and <code>load</code>
member functions wouldn't even be self-consistent. Could be clearer though,
<sref ref="[intro.multithread]"/> talks about reads and writes (and RMW ops)
and only uses "store" and "load" informally. Maybe just add something saying
"reads are also called loads and writes are also called stores".

<p>
This is an addition to this issue, consider this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::atomic&lt;int&gt; x{0};

Thread 1:
int expected = 0;
x.compare_exchange_strong(expected, 1, memory_order::acq_rel, memory_order::relaxed); // #1

Thread 2:
int expected = 1;
while(x. compare_exchange_strong(expected, 2, memory_order::acq_rel, memory_order::relaxed)){} // #2
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>memory_order::acq_rel</tt> performs a release operation when the operation is a store and is 
an acquire operation when the operation is a load. It is unclear what operations <tt>#1</tt> and 
<tt>#2</tt> are considered when they succeed, as pointed out in the original issue, we still don't 
specify whether RMW is classified as load or store operation or can be both.
<p/>
We should specify how the <tt>success</tt> order affects the RMW when it is viewed as a load or store 
operation.
