<p>
This is from editorial issue <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1031">#1031</a>.
<p/>
The first row in Table 112 "Position type requirements"
talks about the expression <tt>P(i)</tt> and then has an assertion
<tt>p == P(i)</tt>.  However, there are no constraints on <tt>p</tt>
other than being of type <tt>P</tt>, so (on the face of it) this
seems to require that <tt>operator==</tt> on <tt>P</tt> always returns
true, which is non-sensical.
