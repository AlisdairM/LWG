<p>
<sref ref="[alg.three.way]"/>/2 specifies the effects of the <tt>lexicographical_compare_three_way</tt> 
algorithm via a large "equivalent to" codeblock. This codeblock specifies one more iterator comparison 
than necessary when the first input sequence is greater than the second, and two more than necessary
in other cases. Requiring unnecessary work is the antithesis of C++.
