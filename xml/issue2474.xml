<p>
Using numeric wrappers with <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> functions is currently troublesome.
Code such as: "<tt>std::exp2(std::integral_constant&lt;int, 5&gt;{})</tt>" will fail to 
compile because of ambiguity.
<p/>
Arguments which are implicitly convertible to an arithmetic type should be accepted whenever
the latter would be accepted.
<p/>
David Krauss pointed out that some issue may present itself with numeric libraries which provide <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> 
equivalents in their own namespace which are not more specialized than the ones provided in <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt>. 
If the changes proposed are implemented, then cases where the user brings those into scope through ADL might become ambiguous.
<p/>
It's hard to assess how much breakage this would cause in the wild, and how much work it would take to fix. 
Should this be determined to be a problem, it's possible to make the new behaviour optional, and disabled by 
default for all user-defined types.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4296.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Change <sref ref="[c.math]"/> p11 b2 as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-11- Moreover, there shall be additional overloads sufficient to ensure:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
<li><p>Otherwise, if any arithmetic argument corresponding to a <tt>double</tt> parameter has type <tt>double</tt> or 
<del>an integer type</del><ins>a type which is not floating-point, but which is implicitly convertible to <tt>double</tt></ins>, 
then all arithmetic arguments corresponding to <tt>double</tt> parameters are effectively cast to <tt>double</tt>.</p></li>
<li><p>[&hellip;]</p></li>
