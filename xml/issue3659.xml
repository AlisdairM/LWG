<p>
<paper num="P0883R2"/> deprecated <tt>ATOMTIC_VAR_INIT</tt> and
<tt>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</tt> largely based on rationale from WG14. However, WG14
only deprecated <tt>ATOMIC_VAR_INIT</tt> because we were told by implementers
that <tt>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</tt> is still necessary for some platforms (platforms
for which "clear" is actually not all zero bits, which I guess exist).
<p/>
I'd like to explore whether WG21 should undeprecate <tt>ATOMIC_FLAG_INIT</tt>
as there was no motivation that I could find in the paper on the topic
or in the discussion at 
<a href="https://wiki.edg.com/bin/view/Wg21jacksonville2018/P0883R0">P0883R0 [Jacksonville 2018]</a>.
