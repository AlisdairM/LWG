<title>Specify that <tt>nullopt_t</tt> is copyable</title>

<p>
The Standard defines a number of types that are used to create overload disambiguators for constructors, 
like <tt>nullopt_t</tt> and <tt>allocator_tag_t</tt>. Values of such types are passed by value to such 
constructors to give it particular meaning. For pass-by-value these types need to be copy-constructible 
and for consistency should also be copy-assignable. Of those types the specification of <tt>nullopt_t</tt> 
doesn't clearly state that the type is copyable, <sref ref="[optional.nullopt]"/>.
<p/>
The reason that <tt>nullopt_t</tt> is defined differently from other such types is to avoid ambiguity 
in expressions that assign an empty brace initializer to an <tt>optional</tt>. The meaning of such 
assignment should be to engage the <tt>optional</tt> instead of taking the braces to create a temporary 
<tt>nullopt_t</tt> for assignment and thus reset the <tt>optional</tt>.
<p/>
Types that aren't affected: <tt>nullptr_t</tt> (fundamental type), <tt>allocator_tag_t</tt>, 
<tt>piecewise_construct_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_type_t</tt>, <tt>in_place_index_t</tt> 
(all basically defined as a <tt>class <i>T</i> { explicit <i>T</i>() = default; }</tt> which works fine for pass-by-value)

This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4892">N4892</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[optional.nullopt]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
struct nullopt_t{<i>see below</i>};
inline constexpr nullopt_t nullopt(<i>unspecified</i>);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- The struct <tt>nullopt_t</tt> is an empty class type used as a unique type to indicate 
the state of not containing a value for <tt>optional</tt> objects. In particular, 
<tt>optional&lt;T&gt;</tt> has a constructor with <tt>nullopt_t</tt> as a single
argument; this indicates that an optional object not containing a value shall be constructed.
<p/>
-2- Type <tt>nullopt_t</tt> shall not have a default constructor or an initializer-list 
constructor, <del>and</del> shall not be an aggregate<ins>, and shall have a copy constructor 
and a copy assignment operator, both shall be public and trivial</ins>.
</p>
