<p>
Several feature-test macros are available in C++ versions of C headers (e.g. <tt>__cpp_lib_byte</tt> is available in 
<tt>&lt;cstddef&gt;</tt>). However, the current standard wording doesn't seem to make the distinction between C++ library 
feature-test macros and macros from C, so it's not very clear that whether <tt>&lt;stddef.h&gt;</tt> and its friends are 
required to provide <tt>__cpp_lib_*</tt> macros in C++.
<p/>
Presumably, <tt><i>name</i>.h</tt> should provide macros shown in the synopsis of its corresponding <tt>c<i>name</i></tt> 
(as required in C), but should not be required to provide C++ library feature-test macros because such requirement would 
generally require implementations of the C standard library to change. I think we should make clarification in 
<sref ref="[support.c.headers.general]"/>.
