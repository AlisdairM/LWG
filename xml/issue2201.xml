<p>
It seems that in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 150 the following macros from <sref ref="[c.limits]"/>, Table 31 
are missing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
LLONG_MIN 
LLONG_MAX
ULLONG_MAX
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
In addition in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 150 the following macros from <sref ref="[c.limits]"/>, Table 32 
are missing:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
DECIMAL_DIG 
FLT_EVAL_METHOD
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Furtheron it seems that in <sref ref="[diff.library]"/>, Table 149/150 further macros are missing as well, e.g. 
<tt>HUGE_VALF</tt>, <tt>INFINITY</tt>, etc.
</p>

<p>
This is an issue, all of C has not been updated for C99, C99 functions are missing, whole section needs to be overhauled.
<p/>
The issue needs to be updated for functions and other missing items and when that happens the issue title is wrong and
needs to be adapted.

<p>
We suggest to either:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>
Having a paper to rewrite C.5 C standard library by striking
the content shared by C and C++ and leave only the
differences;
</p></li>
<li><p>
Having a paper, or a complete proposed wording to fix
the missing names added between C89 and C99.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
For 1), some C11 headers being excluded from C++ (such as
<tt>thread.h</tt>) need to be added to this section.
</p>
