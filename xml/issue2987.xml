<p>
For a user to implement a regular expression traits class meaningfully, the relationship between the return value of <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> to the behaviour of the finite state machine corresponding to a regular expression 
needs to be better specified.
<p/>
From <a href="https://wg21.link/n4660">N4660</a> subclause 31.13 [re.grammar], <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> 
only feeds clearly into two operations:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>a test if the returned string is empty ([re.grammar]/8), and</p></li>
<li><p>a test if the result of <tt>traits_inst.transform_primary</tt>, with the returned string, 
is empty ([re.grammar]/10).</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
Note: It is unclear if bullet 14.3 in [re.grammar]/14 refers to the result of <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> when 
it refers to a "collating element"; and if it does, it is unclear what input is to be used.
<p/>
It is therefore unclear what the effect is if <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> substitutes another member of the 
equivalence class as its output.
<p/>
For example, when processing <tt>"[[.AA.]]"</tt> as a pattern under a locale <tt>da_DK.utf8</tt>, what is the expected 
behaviour difference (if any) should <tt>traits_inst.lookup_collatename</tt> return, for <tt>"AA"</tt>, <tt>"\u00C5"</tt> 
(where <tt>U+00C5</tt> is A with ring, which sorts the same as <tt>"AA"</tt>)?
