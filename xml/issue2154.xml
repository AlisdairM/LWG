<title>What exactly does compile-time complexity imply?</title>

<p>
The expressions <tt>G::min()</tt> and <tt>G::max()</tt> in Table 116 in <sref ref="[rand.req.urng]"/> are specified 
as having "compile-time" complexity.
<p/>
It is not clear what, exactly, this requirement implies.  If a URNG has a method:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
static int min();
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
then is the method required to have a <tt>constexpr</tt> qualifier?  I believe the standard would benefit from 
clarification of this point.
