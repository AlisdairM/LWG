<sref ref="[syncstream.syncbuf.members]"/> p2 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Postconditions:</i> On success, the associated output is empty.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Are there any postconditions on failure? If part of the associated output was written, is that 
part still in the associated output? Will another call to <tt>emit()</tt> duplicate that part?
