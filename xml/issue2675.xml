<p>
<tt>register_callback</tt> allocates memory and so it can fail, but the case is unspecified. libc++ sets
<tt>badbit</tt>, which is consistent with <tt>iword</tt> and <tt>pword</tt>. libstdc++ throws <tt>std::bad_alloc</tt>.

<p>
Just as an additional data point: MSVC++ agrees with libstdc++ and also throws <tt>std::bad_alloc</tt>.
