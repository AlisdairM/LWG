<p>
I recently encountered a failure related to questionable use of <tt>do_get_year</tt>. The platform where the code happened 
to work had an implementation which handled certain three-digit "year identifiers" as the number of years since 
1900 (<a href="http://www.drdobbs.com/cpp/remembering-y2k/228701726">this article</a> describes such an implementation).
<p/>
<sref ref="[locale.time.get.virtuals]"/> makes it implementation defined whether two-digit years are accepted, etc., but does not 
say anything specifically about three-digit years.
<p/>
The implementation freedom to not report errors in <sref ref="[locale.time.get]"/> paragraph 1 also seems to be too broad.
<p/>

<p>Wed PM: This has been this way since C++98. Don't think it's a P2.</p>
<p>Change to P4, and move to Open.</p>
