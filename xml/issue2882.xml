<p>Clarify <tt>variant</tt> construction</p>
<p>Proposed change: Add a note that <tt>variant&lt;&gt;</tt> cannot be constructed.</p>

<note>2017-02-03, Marshall comments</note>
<p>[variant]/3 now says "A program that instantiates the definition of <tt>variant</tt> with no template arguments is ill-formed."</p>
