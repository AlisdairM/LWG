<p>
<sref ref="[bit.endian]"/> says that "big-endian" and "little-endian" refer to whether bytes are stored 
in descending or ascending order of significance. In other words, when <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is either 
<tt>std::endian::big</tt> or <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, we are told something about the object representations o
f multi-byte scalar types. However, the guarantee provided in this case is not strong enough to fully specify 
the object representation, even in the common situation where padding bits are not present. It would be more 
useful to provide a stronger guarantee.
<p/>
Consider, for example, if <tt>char</tt> is 8 bits and there is an <tt>uint32_t</tt> type on the current platform. 
If <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, then the program should be able to rely on the 
fact that if a <tt>uint32_t</tt> object is copied into an array of 4 <tt>unsigned char</tt>, then the value of 
the first element of that array actually equals the original value modulo 256. However, because 
<paper num="P1236R1"/> removed the core language specification of the value representation of unsigned integer 
types, the program cannot actually rely on this. It is conceivable (though unlikely), for example, that 
<tt>std::endian::native</tt> could be <tt>std::endian::little</tt> but the first byte in a <tt>uint32_t</tt> 
object is actually the least significant 8 bits flipped, or the least significant 8 bits permuted, or something 
like that.
