<sref ref="[bit.endian]"/> says that "big-endian" and "little-endian" refer to whether bytes are stored 
in descending or ascending order of significance. In other words, when <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is either 
<tt>std::endian::big</tt> or <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, we are told something about the object representations o
f multi-byte scalar types. However, the guarantee provided in this case is not strong enough to fully specify 
the object representation, even in the common situation where padding bits are not present. It would be more 
useful to provide a stronger guarantee.
<p/>
Consider, for example, if <tt>char</tt> is 8 bits and there is an <tt>uint32_t</tt> type on the current platform. 
If <tt>std::endian::native</tt> is <tt>std::endian::little</tt>, then the program should be able to rely on the 
fact that if a <tt>uint32_t</tt> object is copied into an array of 4 <tt>unsigned char</tt>, then the value of 
the first element of that array actually equals the original value modulo 256. However, because 
<paper num="P1236R1"/> removed the core language specification of the value representation of unsigned integer 
types, the program cannot actually rely on this. It is conceivable (though unlikely), for example, that 
<tt>std::endian::native</tt> could be <tt>std::endian::little</tt> but the first byte in a <tt>uint32_t</tt> 
object is actually the least significant 8 bits flipped, or the least significant 8 bits permuted, or something 
like that.

<note>Jonathan expressed shock that <paper num="P1236R1"/> remove portability guarantees that were previously present.</note>
<note>Jens explained that no observable guarantees were ever present anyway, which is why Core removed the wording.</note>

I agree with the thrust of the issue (i.e. the special values for
<code>std::endian</code> should permit reliance on a particular object
representation), but I disagree with the wording chosen.  The
"pure binary" phrasing that is sort-of defined in a footnote
is bad.  I think we want to say that all scalar types have no
padding bits and that the base-2 representation of
an unsigned integer type is formed by the bit concatenation
of the base-2 representations of the "unsigned char" values that
comprise the object representation of that unsigned integer type.
"bit concatenation" should best be phrased in math, e.g.
given a value <em>x</em> of some unsigned integer type and the
sequence of unsigned char values c<sup>j</sup> (each having width M)
comprising the object representation of x,
the coefficients of the base-2 representation of x are
 x<sub>i</sub> = c<sup>&lfloor;i/M&rfloor;</sup><sub>i mod M</sub>
or somesuch.  See <sref ref="[expr.bit.and]"/> for some phrasing in this area.

This wording is relative to <paper num="N4950"/>.
