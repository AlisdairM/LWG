<sref ref="[rand.req.genl]"/>/1 says: "Throughout this subclause 26.5, the effect of instantiating a template [...] that has a 
template type parameter named <tt>IntType</tt> is undefined unless the corresponding template argument is <i>cv</i>-unqualified 
and is one of <tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>long long</tt>, <tt>unsigned short</tt>, <tt>unsigned int</tt>, 
<tt>unsigned long</tt>, or <tt>unsigned long long</tt>."  <sref ref="[rand.dist.uni.int]"/> specifies 
<tt>template&lt;class IntType = int> class uniform_int_distribution</tt>, so this forbids 
<tt>uniform_int_distribution&lt;char/signed char/unsigned char&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
I am not aware of anything in <tt>&lt;random&gt;</tt> that works with 16-bit integers but fails with 8-bit integers, so I suspect 
that <tt>IntType</tt> and <tt>UIntType</tt> could simply be extended to permit the <tt>char</tt> family. Alternatively, this 
change could be limited to <tt>uniform_int_distribution</tt> alone, where it is definitely safe. A <tt>&lt;random&gt;</tt> expert 
should decide which change is best.

<p>
 I think it's time to call the question; it's just silly that we have a random number library with no natural way to generate 
 random bytes. However, I don't think it's sufficient to fix only <tt>uniform_int_distribution</tt>, or even all of <tt>IntType</tt>. 
 At a bare minimum we need to also fix <tt>independent_bits_engine</tt> (arguably the cleanest way of generating a random byte) 
 and that's specified in terms of <tt>UIntType</tt>.
 <p/>
 The wording provided below is equivalent to adding <tt>unsigned char</tt> to item "f" and adding <tt>signed char</tt> and 
 <tt>unsigned char</tt> to item "e". That means it still excludes <tt>char</tt>, but I'm OK with that. If you want to generate 
 a 1-byte number, you should probably pick a signedess, and if you want to generate a raw byte, the "true" raw byte type is 
 <tt>unsigned char</tt>. This also excludes extended integral types and wide char types, which seem like nice-to-haves at best. 
 I have no objection to supporting any of those types; I just picked this to simplify the wording and hopefully maximize consensus. 
 Note that if we want to broaden <tt>IntType</tt> to permit any integral type, we'll need to decide if we want to exclude <tt>bool</tt>.
<p/>
For reference, <tt>IntType</tt> is used as a parameter of the following templates:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
uniform_int_distribution
binomial_distribution
geometric_distribution
negative_binomial_distribution
poisson_distribution
discrete_distribution
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
and <tt>UIntType</tt> is used as a parameter of the following templates:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
linear_congruential_engine
mersenne_twister_engine
subtract_with_carry_engine
independent_bits_engine
</pre>
</blockquote>

<note>2015-9-11, Telecom</note>
<p>Walter feels very strongly that this is not a defect, but a feature request.</p>
<p>In a previous telecom, Aaron offered to write a paper proposing this.</p>
<p>Jonathan offered to help.</p>

<p>Closing as NAD</p>
