<p>
After acceptance of <a href="http://wg21.link/P0941R2">P0941R2</a> into the working draft, in [support.limits.general], 
<tt>__cpp_lib_to_chars</tt> is required to be in <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>. Since the relevant feature 
(<tt>std::to_chars</tt> and <tt>std::from_chars</tt>) is now in the header <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, 
should the macro be defined in <tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt> instead of <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>?
</p>
<note>Marshall provides P/R and context</note>
<p><tt>std::to_chars</tt>, etc were originally proposed for the header <tt>&lt;utility&gt;</tt>
and SD-6 reflected that. Somewhere along the way, they was put into their own header 
<tt>&lt;charconv&gt;</tt>, but the document was never updated to reflect that.</p>
<p>When these macros were added to the standard, the (now incorrect) value was copied as well.</p>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to (the Rapperswil post-mailing standard).</p>

<p>Change <sref ref="[support.limits.general]"/> (Table 35) as indicated:</p>

<table border="1">
<tr><th>Macro name</th><th>Value</th><th>Header(s)</th></tr>
<tr><td><tt>__cpp_lib_to_chars</tt></td><td><tt>201611L</tt></td><td><tt>&lt;<ins>charconv</ins><del>utility</del>&gt;</tt></td></tr>
