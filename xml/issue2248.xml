<p>
This member should probably be named "is_ieee754". Or at least the standard should explain that IEC-559 no longer exists, 
and that it's been superseded by IEEE-754.

<note>2016-06, Oulu</note>
<p>The ISO version of the standard is ISO/IEC/IEEE 60559:2011,
which C11 Annex F refers to as IEC 60559
(although C still refers to it as IEC 559 in the <code>__STDC_IEC_559__</code> macro).
