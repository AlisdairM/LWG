<p>
<tt>promise</tt>, <tt>packaged_task</tt>, and <tt>async</tt> are the only
places where a shared state is actually supposed to be allocated. Accordingly,
<tt>promise</tt> and <tt>packaged_task</tt> are "allocator-aware". But
function template <tt>async</tt> provides no way to provide an allocator.

We want whatever status approximates: "will not fix; we're working on a replacement facility and don't want to add features to a broken one"
