<b>Addresses CA 1</b>
<p><a href="http://wg21.link/p0270r1">P0270R1</a> went through SG1 and LWG but was too late to make it to the straw polls.</p>
<p>The problems it addresses stem from referring to C11, which came into C++17 at the last minute.</p>
<p>P0270R1 should have made it in with the C11 change.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Apply all of P0270R1, "Removing C dependencies from signal handler wording", to C++17.</p>
