<title>Clarify entity vs. freestanding entity</title>

<sref ref="[freestanding.entity]"/> p1 defines a freestanding entity as
a declaration or macro definition.
</p>

<p>
<sref ref="[freestanding.entity]"/> p3 then says
"entities followed with a comment [&hellip;] are freestanding entities".
</p>

<p>
This is inconsistent, and breaks with macros,
because macros are not entities, but they can be freestanding entities.
</p>

<p>
Set priority to 2 after reflector poll.

<p>
It's confusing for "freestanding entities" to be two things, neither of which are entities. Declarations may declare entities, they are not entities themselves. Given this definition, p6/7/8 makes no sense. A namespace can't be a freestanding entity since it's neither a declaration nor a macro definition.
</p>
<p>
"freestanding entities" is not best name, given the collision with core entity, but I think that this is separable issue.

Set status to Tentatively Ready after five votes in favour during reflector poll.
