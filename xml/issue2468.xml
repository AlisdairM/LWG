Suppose we write
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector&lt;string&gt; v{"a", "b", "c", "d"};
v = move(v);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
What should be the state of <tt>v</tt> be? The standard doesn't say anything specific about self-move-assignment. 
There's relevant text in several parts of the standard, and it's not clear how to reconcile them.
<p/>
<sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> writes that, for all functions in the standard library, unless explicitly stated 
otherwise, "If a function argument binds to an rvalue reference parameter, the implementation may assume that this 
parameter is a unique reference to this argument." The <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements table in 
<sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> writes that, given <tt>t = rv</tt>, <tt>t</tt>'s state is equivalent to 
<tt>rv</tt>'s from before the assignment and <tt>rv</tt>'s state is unspecified (but valid). For containers 
specifically, the requirements table in <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> says that, given <tt>a = rv</tt>, 
<tt>a</tt> becomes equal to what <tt>rv</tt> was before the assignment (and doesn't say anything about <tt>rv</tt>'s 
state post-assignment).
<p/>
Taking each of these pieces in isolation, without reference to the other two:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> would clearly imply that the effect of <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined.</p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> has defined behavior. 
It might be read to imply that this is a no-op, or might be read to imply that it leaves <tt>v</tt> in a valid but 
unspecified state; I'm not sure which reading is more natural.</p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is a no-op.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not clear from the text how to put these pieces together, because it's not clear which one takes precedence.  
Maybe <sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> wins (it imposes an implicit precondition that isn't mentioned in the 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined), or maybe 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> wins (it explicitly gives additional guarantees for 
<tt>Container::operator=</tt> beyond what's guaranteed for library functions in general, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> 
is a no-op), or maybe something else.
<p/>
On the existing implementations that I checked, for what it's worth, <tt>v = move(v)</tt> appeared to clear the vector; 
it didn't leave the vector unchanged and it didn't cause a crash.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording</em>:
<p/>
Informally: change the <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> and Container requirements tables (and any other requirements tables 
that mention move assignment, if any) to make it explicit that <tt>x = move(x)</tt> is defined behavior and it leaves 
<tt>x</tt> in a valid but unspecified state. That's probably not what the standard says today, but it's probably what 
we intended and it's consistent with what we've told users and with what implementations actually do.
