Suppose we write
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
vector&lt;string&gt; v{"a", "b", "c", "d"};
v = move(v);
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
What should be the state of <tt>v</tt> be? The standard doesn't say anything specific about self-move-assignment. 
There's relevant text in several parts of the standard, and it's not clear how to reconcile them.
<p/>
<sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> writes that, for all functions in the standard library, unless explicitly stated 
otherwise, "If a function argument binds to an rvalue reference parameter, the implementation may assume that this 
parameter is a unique reference to this argument." The <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements table in 
<sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> writes that, given <tt>t = rv</tt>, <tt>t</tt>'s state is equivalent to 
<tt>rv</tt>'s from before the assignment and <tt>rv</tt>'s state is unspecified (but valid). For containers 
specifically, the requirements table in <sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> says that, given <tt>a = rv</tt>, 
<tt>a</tt> becomes equal to what <tt>rv</tt> was before the assignment (and doesn't say anything about <tt>rv</tt>'s 
state post-assignment).
<p/>
Taking each of these pieces in isolation, without reference to the other two:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> would clearly imply that the effect of <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined.</p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[utility.arg.requirements]"/> would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> has defined behavior. 
It might be read to imply that this is a no-op, or might be read to imply that it leaves <tt>v</tt> in a valid but 
unspecified state; I'm not sure which reading is more natural.</p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> would clearly imply that <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is a no-op.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
It's not clear from the text how to put these pieces together, because it's not clear which one takes precedence.  
Maybe <sref ref="[res.on.arguments]"/> wins (it imposes an implicit precondition that isn't mentioned in the 
<tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> is undefined), or maybe 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/> wins (it explicitly gives additional guarantees for 
<tt>Container::operator=</tt> beyond what's guaranteed for library functions in general, so <tt>v = move(v)</tt> 
is a no-op), or maybe something else.
<p/>
On the existing implementations that I checked, for what it's worth, <tt>v = move(v)</tt> appeared to clear the vector; 
it didn't leave the vector unchanged and it didn't cause a crash.
<p/>
<em>Proposed wording</em>:
<p/>
Informally: change the <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> and Container requirements tables (and any other requirements tables 
that mention move assignment, if any) to make it explicit that <tt>x = move(x)</tt> is defined behavior and it leaves 
<tt>x</tt> in a valid but unspecified state. That's probably not what the standard says today, but it's probably what 
we intended and it's consistent with what we've told users and with what implementations actually do.

<p>JW: So far, the library forbids self-assignment since it assumes that anything bound to an rvalue reference has no aliases. But self-assignment can happen in real code, and it can be implemented. So I want to add an exception to the Standard that this should be allowed and leave the object in a valid-but-unspecified state.</p>
<p>STL: When this is resolved, I want to see a) VBU for library types after self-move, but also b) requirements on user types for self-moves. E.g. should algorithms be required to avoid self-assignments (since a user-defined type might blow up)? HH: In other words, should we require that you can assign from moved-from values.</p>
<p>WEB: What can one generally do with moved-from values?</p>
<p>VV: Call any member function that has no preconditions.</p>
<p>JW: That's certainly the library requirement, and it's also good guidance for user types.</p>
<p>JW: I'm writing wording. I care about this.</p>

<p>
In [swappable.requirements], modify Table 23 &mdash; <code>MoveAssignable</code> requirements [moveassignable]:
</p>

<blockquote>

<table border="1">
<caption>Table 23 &mdash; <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> requirements [moveassignable]</caption>
<tr>
<th>Expression</th>
<th>Return type</th>
<th>Return value</th>
<th>Post-condition</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><tt>t = rv</tt></td>
<td><tt>T&amp;</tt></td>
<td><tt>t</tt></td>
<td><ins>If <tt>addressof(t) != addressof(rv)</tt>,</ins> <tt>t</tt> is
equivalent to the value of <tt>rv</tt> before the assignment</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td colspan=4>
<tt>rv</tt>'s state is unspecified. [<i>Note:</i> <tt>rv</tt> must
still meet the requirements of the library component that is using it<ins>,
whether or not <tt><tt>addressof(t) == addressof(rv)</tt></tt></ins>. The
operations listed in those requirements must work as specified whether
<tt>rv</tt> has been moved from or not. &mdash; <i>end note</i>] </td>
