<p>
In C++03 the following two programs are invalid:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:upper-alpha"><li>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

int main() {
  std::abs(0u);
}
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;cstdlib&gt;

int main() {
  std::abs(0u);
}
</pre></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<p>
because none of the <tt>std::abs()</tt> overloads is a best match.
</p>
<p>
In C++11 the additional "sufficient overload" rule from <sref ref="[c.math]"/> p11 (see also LWG
<iref ref="2086"/>) can be read to be applicable to the <tt>std::abs()</tt> overloads as well, which
can lead to the following possible conclusions:
<p/>
<ol>
<li><p>The program</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;type_traits&gt;
#include &lt;cmath&gt;

static_assert(std::is_same&lt;decltype(std::abs(0u)), double&gt;(), "Oops");

int main() {
  std::abs(0u); // Calls std::abs(double)
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is required to be well-formed, because of sub-bullet 2 ("[..] or an integer type [..]") of 
<sref ref="[c.math]"/> p11 (Note that the current resolution of LWG <iref ref="2086"/> doesn't
fix this problem).
</p>
</li>
<li><p>Any translation unit including both <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>
might be ill-formed because of two conflicting requirements for the return type of the overload
<tt>std::abs(int)</tt>.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>
It seems to me that at least the second outcome is not intended, personally I think that both
are unfortunate: In contrast to all other floating-point functions explicitly listed in sub-clause 
<sref ref="[c.math]"/>, the <tt>abs</tt> overloads have a special and well-defined meaning for 
signed integers and thus have explicit overloads returning a signed integral type. I also believe that 
there is no problem accepting that <tt>std::fabs(0u)</tt> is well-defined with return type <tt>double</tt>, 
because the leading 'f' clearly signals that we have a floating point function here. But the expected 
return type of <tt>std::abs(0u)</tt> seems less than clear to me. A very reasonable answer could be that 
this has the same type as its argument type, alternatively it could be a reasonably chosen signed 
integer type, or a floating point type. It should also be noted, that the corresponding
"generic type function" rule set from C99/C1x in 7.25 p2+3 is restricted to the floating-point functions
from <tt>&lt;math.h&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;complex.h&gt;</tt>, so cannot be applied to the <tt>abs</tt>
functions (but to the <tt>fabs</tt> functions!).
<p/>
Selecting a signed integer return type for unsigned input values can also problematic: The directly
corresponding signed integer type would give half of the possible argument values an implementation-defined
result value. Choosing the first signed integer value that can represent all positive values would solve this
problem for <tt>unsigned int</tt>, but there would be no clear answer for the input type <tt>std::uintmax_t</tt>.
</p>
<p>
Based on this it seems to me that the C++03 state in regard to unsigned integer values was the better
situation, alerting the user that this code is ambigious at the moment (This might be change with different core-language
rules as described in N3387).

Resolution: leave as new and bring it back in Chicago.

This issue also relates to LWG <iref ref="2294"/>
<p/> 
STL: these two issues should be bundled 
<p/>
Stefanus: do what Pete says, and add overloads for unsigned to return directly 
<p/>
STL: agree Consensus that this is an issue 
<p/>
Walter: motion to move to Open 
<p/>
STL: no wording for <iref ref="2294"/> 
<p/>
Stefanus: move to open and note the 2 issues are related and should be moved together 
<p/>
Stefanus: add and define unsigned versions of <tt>abs()</tt>
</p>

<note>2014-02-03 Howard comments</note>
<p>
Defining <tt>abs()</tt> for unsigned integers is a bad idea. Doing so would turn compile time errors into run time errors, 
especially in C++ where we have templates, and the types involved are not always apparent to the programmer at design time.  
For example, consider:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
template &lt;class Int&gt;
Int
analyze(Int x, Int y)
{
  // ...
  if (std::abs(<span style="color:#C80000;font-weight:bolder">x - y</span>) &lt; threshold)
  {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
<tt>std::abs(<i>expr</i>)</tt> is often used to ask: Are these two numbers sufficiently close?  When the assumption is that 
the two numbers are signed (either signed integral, or floating point), the logic is sound. But when the same logic is 
accidentally used with an arithmetic type not capable of representing negative numbers, and especially if unsigned overflow 
will silently happen, then the logic is no longer correct:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto i = analyze(20u, 21u);  // Today a compile time error
    // But with <tt>abs(unsigned)</tt> becomes a run time error
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is not idle speculation. Search the net for "<tt>abs unsigned</tt>" 
<a href="http://www.avrfreaks.net/index.php?name=PNphpBB2&amp;file=printview&amp;t=35514&amp;start=0">here</a> or 
<a href="http://fischerlaender.de/mysql/surprising-mysql-behaviour-using-unsigned-int">here</a>.
<p/>
In C++11, <tt>chrono</tt> <tt>duration</tt>s and <tt>time_point</tt>s are allowed to be based on unsigned integers. Taking the 
absolute value of the difference of two such <tt>time_point</tt>s would be easy to accidentally do (say in code templated on 
<tt>time_point</tt>s), and would certainly be a logic bug, caught at compile time unless we provide the error prone <tt>abs(unsigned)</tt>.

GR: Do we want to make the changes to both <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>?<br/> 
AM: I think so; we should provide consistent overloads.<br/> 
GR: Then we're imposing restrictions on what users put in the global namespace.<br/> 
AM: I'm not so worried about that. Users already know not to use C library names.<br/>
VV: So what are we going to do about unsigned integers? AM: We will say that they are ill-formed.<br/>
AM: Does anyone volunteer to send updated wording to Daniel? GR, can you do it? GR: Sure.<br/>
GR: To clarify: we want to make unsigned types ill-formed?<br/> 
AM: With promotion rank at least <tt>unsigned int</tt>.<br/>
GR: And NL suggests to just list those types.
<p/>
Conclusion: Merge the resolution into a single issue.

<strong>Previous resolution from Daniel [SUPERSEDED]:</strong>
<blockquote class = "note">
<p>This wording is relative to N3376.</p>

<note>2015-03-03, Geoffrey Romer provides improved wording</note>
<p>
In the following I've drafted combined wording to resolve LWG <iref ref="2192"/> and <iref ref="2294"/>. Note that the first 
two paragraphs are taken verbatim from the P/R of LWG <iref ref="2294"/>, but the third is newly drafted:

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4527.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Insert the following new paragraphs after <sref ref="[c.math]"/> p7:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-6- In addition to the <tt>int</tt> versions of certain math functions in <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>, C++ adds <tt>long</tt> 
and <tt>long long</tt> overloaded versions of these functions, with the same semantics.
<p/>
-7- The added signatures are:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
long abs(long); <i>// labs()</i>
long long abs(long long); <i>// llabs()</i>
ldiv_t div(long, long); <i>// ldiv()</i>
lldiv_t div(long long, long long); <i>// lldiv()</i>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- To avoid ambiguities, C++ also adds the following overloads of <tt>abs()</tt> to <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>, 
with the semantics defined in <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt>:</ins>
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<ins>float abs(float);
double abs(double);
long double abs(long double);</ins>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- To avoid ambiguities, C++ also adds the following overloads of <tt>abs()</tt> to <tt>&lt;cmath&gt;</tt>, 
with the semantics defined in <tt>&lt;cstdlib&gt;</tt>:</ins>
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
<ins>int abs(int);
long abs(long);
long long abs(long long);</ins>
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
<ins>-?- If <tt>abs()</tt> is called with an argument of type <tt>X</tt> for which
<tt>is_unsigned&lt;X&gt;::value</tt> is <tt>true</tt> and if <tt>X</tt> cannot be converted to
<tt>int</tt> by integral promotion (<sref ref="[conv.prom]"/>), the program is ill-formed.
[<i>Note</i>: arguments that can be promoted to <tt>int</tt> are permitted for
compatibility with C. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</ins>
