<p>
LWG <iref ref="270"/> relaxed the requirements for <tt>comp</tt> of binary search algorithms 
(<sref ref="[alg.binary.search]"/>). However, the relaxation doesn't seem automatically applied 
to <tt>ranges</tt> versions, because <tt>ranges</tt> versions of these algorithms constrain the 
<tt>Comp</tt> types with <tt>indirect_strict_weak_order</tt>.
<p/>
Perhaps we should additionally say some semantic requirements of <tt>indirect_strict_weak_order</tt> 
aren't imposed for these algorithms or change the constraints.
