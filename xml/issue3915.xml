Originally editorial issue <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/4431">Editorial issue #4431</a>.
<p/>
Expression variations kick in for "an expression that is non-modifying for some constant lvalue operand", but 
<tt>std::ranges::range</tt>'s is an non-constant lvalue, so <sref ref="[range.range]"/> p2 is redundant.
<p/>
I suppose that the change that clarified the template parameters' <i>cv</i>-qualification for purposes of 
equality-preservation and requiring additional variations happened concurrently with the change of 
<tt>std::ranges::range</tt>'s operand from a forwarding reference to a non-constant lvalue reference.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4944"/>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Modify <sref ref="[ranges.syn]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- The <tt>range</tt> concept defines the requirements of a type that allows iteration over its elements by providing an
iterator and sentinel that denote the elements of the range.
</p>
<pre>
template&lt;class T&gt;
  concept range =
    requires(T&amp; t) {
      ranges::begin(t); // <i>sometimes equality-preserving (see below)</i>
      ranges::end(t);
    };
</pre>
<blockquote>
<del>-2- The required expressions <tt>ranges::begin(t)</tt> and <tt>ranges::end(t)</tt> of the <tt>range</tt> 
concept do not require implicit expression variations (<sref ref="[concepts.equality]"/>).</del>
<p/>
-3- [&hellip;]
</blockquote>
