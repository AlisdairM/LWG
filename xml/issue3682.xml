<p>
Currently (at least since <paper num="P0593R6"/>), the <tt>allocate</tt> function of an allocator is 
required to create an array of elements (<sref ref="[allocator.requirements.general]"/>), which means 
the allocated storage must be properly aligned (otherwise the array of requested size can't be created). 
However, according to paragraph 12 it is also allowed that "the allocator also may silently ignore the 
requested alignment".
<p/>
IMO the allowance is contradictory and should be removed.
