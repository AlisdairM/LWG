<p><b>Addresses: fund.ts</b></p>

<p>
The <i>Exception safety</i> paragraph of <sref ref="[optional.object.assign]"/> calls out <tt>T</tt>'s copy constructor when 
it should refer to <tt>T</tt>'s copy assignment operator.
</p>

<p>
Move to Deferred.  This feature will ship after C++14 and should be revisited then.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[optional.object.assign]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote><pre>
optional&lt;T&gt;&amp; operator=(const optional&lt;T&gt;&amp; rhs);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
[&hellip;]
<p/>
-8- <i>Exception safety:</i> If any exception is thrown, the values of <tt>init</tt> and <tt>rhs.init</tt> remain unchanged. If
an exception is thrown during the call to <tt>T</tt>'s copy constructor, no effect. If an exception is thrown
during the call to <tt>T</tt>'s copy assignment, the state of its contained value is as defined by the exception
safety guarantee of <tt>T</tt>'s copy <del>constructor</del><ins>assignment</ins>.
</p>
</blockquote></blockquote>
</li>
