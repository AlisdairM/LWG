<p>
[bitmask.types] specifies the semantics of a bitmask type in terms of an "exposition only" <tt>enum</tt> definition, 
together with some constants and overloads. Notably, it is depicted as an unscoped enum, which implies among other 
things that it is implicitly convertible to <tt>int_type</tt>. At least some sources treat that as normative (as 
of this writing, <a href="http://cppreference.com/">cppreference.com</a>'s documentation for 
<a href="http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/concept/BitmaskType"><tt>BitmaskType</tt></a> says the expression 
<tt>(X &amp; Y) != 0</tt> is guaranteed to be well-formed), and it's hard to argue that they're wrong on the basis 
of the existing wording.
<p/>
On the other hand, many standard library types are depicted as scoped enums, but still specified to be "bitmask types". 
As far as I can tell, it's impossible in library code to make a scoped enum implicitly convertible to its underlying type, 
and even if you could, what would be the point? Presumably the specification of those types as scoped enums is intended 
to have some sort of observable consequences.
<p/>
In addition, some library types (notably in clause 31) are specified to be bitmask types, without indicating whether 
they are scoped or unscoped. It's not clear what the standard guarantees about e.g. whether they can be implicitly 
converted.
<p/>
I assume the intent is that "bitmask type" doesn't specify an implicit conversion, or any of the other ways unscoped 
and scoped enums differ, but the standard doesn't actually say that. We really ought to rewrite [bitmask.types] as 
a requirements table, but here's a quick hack to the existing wording as a stopgap.

<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4727">N4727</a>.</p>

<li><p>Edit <sref ref="[bitmask.types]"/> as indicated:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-2- The bitmask type <tt><i>bitmask</i></tt> can be written:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>// For exposition only.</i>
<i>// </i>int_type<i> is an integral type capable of representing all values of the bitmask type.</i>
<del>enum</del><ins><i>E</i></ins> bitmask : int_type {
  V<sub>0</sub> = 1 &lt;&lt; 0, V<sub>1</sub> = 1 &lt;&lt; 1, V<sub>2</sub> = 1 &lt;&lt; 2, V<sub>3</sub> = 1 &lt;&lt; 3, .....
};
[&hellip;]
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
-3- Here, <ins><tt><i>E</i></tt> may represent either <tt>enum</tt> or <tt>enum class</tt> (the choice is implementation-defined 
unless otherwise specified), and</ins> the names <tt><i>C</i><sub>0</sub></tt>, <tt><i>C</i><sub>1</sub></tt>, etc. represent 
<i>bitmask elements</i> for this particular bitmask type. <ins>The zero value <tt><i>bitmask</i>{}</tt> is used to represent an 
<i>empty bitmask</i>, in which no bitmask elements are set.</ins> All <del>such</del><ins>bitmask</ins> elements have distinct, 
nonzero values such that, for any pair <tt><i>C<sub>i</sub></i></tt> and <tt><i>C<sub>j</sub></i></tt> where 
<tt><i>i</i> &ne; <i>j</i></tt>, <tt><i>C<sub>i</sub></i> &amp; <i>C<sub>i</sub></i></tt> is nonzero and 
<tt><i>C<sub>i</sub></i> &amp; <i>C<sub>j</sub></i></tt> is zero. <del>Additionally, the value <tt>0</tt> is used to represent 
an <i>empty bitmask</i>, in which no bitmask elements are set.</del>
