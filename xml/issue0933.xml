<p>
If we are supporting stateful deleters, we need an overload for
<tt>reset</tt> that
takes a deleter as well.
</p>

<blockquote><pre>
void reset( pointer p, deleter_type d);
</pre></blockquote>

<p>
We probably need two overloads to support move-only deleters, and
this
sounds uncomfortably like the two constructors I have been ignoring
for
now...

<note>2017-02 in Kona, LEWG recommends NAD</note>
<p>Pointer-accepting overloads of reset() are discouraged - the same
functionality is available via move-assignment and that is more idiomatic.</p>
