<p>
From the wording, function pointers are never clearly considered. P1 infers
support for only objects, but it is not clear that wording is intended to be a
deliberate restriction, or is casual wording.
<p/>
Paragraph 2 mandates that we cannot instantiate for reference types, and do
support incomplete types, but still does not consider function types. Calling
out references specifically, as they are not object types, suggests the inferred
support for only objects in p1 is more a case of casual phrasing, than deliberate
intent.
<p/>
However, if we did intend to support function pointers, we may want to consider
adding a function-call operator, constrained to supporting pointer-to function types.
One other possibility is that the explicit conversion to <tt>pointer</tt> already serves that
purpose, although I need to double-check the core language that contextual
conversions to function pointer are considered when invoking the function call
operator.  If this <em>is</em> the case, then I suggest a note to that effect in
[memory.observer.ptr.conv] instead.
