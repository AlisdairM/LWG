<p>P0091R3 "Template argument deduction for class templates (Rev. 6)" was adopted for the core language, but the Standard Library makes no explicit use of this new feature, even though the promise of such use provided strong motivation for the feature.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Analyze the Standard Libraryâ€™s constructors to determine which classes would profit from explicit deduction guides. Formulate the appropriate guides for those classes and insert them in their respective types.</p>

<note>Marshall notes (3-Feb-2017)</note>
<p>P0433 is an attempt to do exactly this.</p>
