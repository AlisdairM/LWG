<p>
The spec for <tt>is_trivially_destructible</tt> says the value is true if "<tt>is_destructible_v&lt;T&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt> 
and the indicated destructor is known to be trivial."
<p/>
For a case like <tt>is_trivially_destructible_v&lt;int&gt;</tt>, there is no indicated destructor, so it's unclear what value 
the trait would have but the most plausible reading of these words is that it should be <tt>false</tt>. However, I'm confident 
the intent is that this trait should yield <tt>true</tt> in that situation, and that's what all the implementations I can 
find actually do.
