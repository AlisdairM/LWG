<p>
In general requirements on a whole program, as opposed to a single translation unit, generally specify 
"no diagnostic required", since we don't want to require implementations to do multi-translation-unit 
analysis. However, <sref ref="[new.delete.single]"/> paragraph 11 says,
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If a function with a <tt>size</tt> parameter is defined, the program shall also define the corresponding 
version without the <tt>size</tt> parameter.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is clearly not restricted to a single translation unit; should "no diagnostic required" be added?
