<p>
The standard shows a private default constructor for
<code>bitset&lt;N&gt;::reference</code>
but does not define its semantics, and nothing in the spec refers to it.
It was present in C++98, then in C++11 it got `noexcept` added to it,
and in C++23 it was made `constexpr` by <paper num="P2417R2"/>. That's quite
a lot of churn for an unusuable member function with no definition.
</p>
<p>
In libstdc++ it's declared as private, but never defined.
In libc++ it doesn't exist at all.
In MSVC it is private and defined (and presumably used somewhere).
There's no reason for the standard to declare it.
Implementers can define it as private if they want to, or not.
The spec doesn't need to say anything for that to be true.
We can also remove the friend declaration, because implementers know how to
do that too.
</p>
<p>
I suspect it was added as private originally so that it didn't look like
`reference` should have an implicitly-defined default constructor,
which would have been the case in previous standards with no other
constructors declared.
However, C++20 added <code>reference(const reference&amp;) = default;</code>
which suppresses the implicit default constructor, so declaring the
default constructor as private is now unnecessary.

Jiang An pointed out in an editorial pull request that
<code>vector&lt;bool, Alloc&gt;::reference</code>
has exactly the same issue.
