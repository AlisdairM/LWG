<title>Container requirements (and other library text) should say "strict total order", not just "total order"</title>

<p>
A number of places in the library, including <sref ref="[comparisons]"/>/14, the Optional container requirements in 
<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>, and <sref ref="[thread.thread.id]"/>/8, use the phrase "total order". 
Unfortunately, that phrase is ambiguous. In mathematics, the most common definition is that a relation <tt>&le;</tt> is 
a total order if it's total, transitive, and antisymmetric in the sense that <tt>x&le;y &#x2227; y&le;x &rArr; x=y</tt>. 
What we really want is a strict total order: a relation <tt>&lt;</tt> is a strict total order if it's total, transitive, and 
antisymmetric in the sense that exactly one of <tt>x&lt;y</tt>, <tt>y&lt;x</tt>, and <tt>x=y</tt> holds.
</p>
<p>
The non-normative note in <sref ref="[alg.sorting]"/>/4 correctly uses the phrase "strict total ordering" rather than 
simply "total ordering".
</p>
<p>
We could address this issue by replacing "total order" with "strict total order" everywhere it appears, since I 
think there are no cases where we actually want a non-strict total order, or we could add something in Clause 17 saying 
that we always mean strict total order whenever we say total order.
