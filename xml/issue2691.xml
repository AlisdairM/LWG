<p>
The description of <tt>money_base::space</tt> is that "at least one space is required at that position." 
(N4582 subclause 22.4.6.3 [locale.moneypunct] paragraph 2)
<p/>
When formatting for output (<sref ref="[locale.money.put.virtuals]"/>), it is not clear that
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type:lower-alpha">
<li><p>
"the number of characters generated for the specified format" (excluding fill padding) includes exactly 
one character for <tt>money_base::space</tt> (if present), and
</p></li>
<li><p>
all characters corresponding to <tt>money_base::space</tt> (excluding fill padding) are copies of <tt>fill</tt>.
</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
In particular, there is implementation divergence over point (b) as to whether U+0020 or <tt>fill</tt> should be used.
Further, should a character other than <tt>fill</tt> be used, it is unclear when "the fill characters are 
placed where <tt>none</tt> or <tt>space</tt> appears in the formatting pattern", whether the fill characters are placed 
at the beginning or the end of the "space field".
<p/>
I believe that a strict interpretation of the current wording supports U+0020; however, <tt>fill</tt> is more likely 
to be the pragmatic choice.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to N4582.
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Change <sref ref="[locale.moneypunct]"/> paragraph 2 as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-2- Where <tt>none</tt> or <tt>space</tt> appears, white space is permitted in the format, except where <tt>none</tt> 
appears at the end, in which case no white space is permitted. <ins>For input, the value <tt>space</tt> indicates that 
at least one space is required at that position. For output, the value <tt>space</tt> indicates one instance of the 
fill character (<sref ref="[locale.money.put.virtuals]"/>).</ins><del>The value <tt>space</tt> indicates that at least one 
space is required at that position</del>. Where <tt>symbol</tt> appears, the sequence of characters returned by 
<tt>curr_symbol()</tt> is permitted, and can be required. Where <tt>sign</tt> appears, the first (if any) of the 
sequence of characters returned by <tt>positive_sign()</tt> or <tt>negative_sign()</tt> (respectively as the monetary 
value is non-negative or negative) is required. Any remaining characters of the sign sequence are required after all 
other format components. Where <tt>value</tt> appears, the absolute numeric monetary value is required.
