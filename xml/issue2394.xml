<sref ref="[locale.members]"/> p5 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Returns</i>: The name of <tt>*this</tt>, if it has one; otherwise, the string <tt>"*"</tt>. If <tt>*this</tt> has a name, then
<tt>locale(name().c_str())</tt> is equivalent to <tt>*this</tt>. Details of the contents of the resulting string are
otherwise implementation-defined.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So&hellip; what is implementation-defined here, exactly? The first sentence <em>completely</em> defines the behavior of this function 
in all cases.
<p/>
Also, the second sentence says (effectively) that all locales with the same name are equivalent: given <tt>L1</tt> and <tt>L2</tt> 
that have the same name <tt>N</tt>, they are both equivalent to <tt>locale(N)</tt>, and since there is no definition of 
"equivalent" local to <tt>locale</tt>, I assume it's the normal transitive equivalence property, which would imply that 
<tt>L1</tt> is equivalent to <tt>L2</tt>. I'm not sure why this central fact is in the description of <tt>locale::name</tt>, nor 
why it's written in this roundabout way.
