<p>
<sref ref="[new.delete.dataraces]"/> uses obsolete wording.
<p/>
It should introduce a "synchronizes with" relationship. "Happens before" is too weak, since that may not composes 
with sequenced before.
<p/>
The "shall not introduce a data race" wording is probably not technically correct either. These may race with other 
(non-allocation/deallocation) concurrent accesses to the object being allocated or deallocated.
