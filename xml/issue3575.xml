<p>
It seems that the return type of <tt>&lt;=&gt;</tt> for integer-class types is not specified consistently with 
other comparison operators. Even <paper num="P2393R0"/> has ignored it.
<p/>
IMO <tt>strong_ordering</tt> should be added to <sref ref="[iterator.concept.winc]"/>/(5.3), and 
<tt>three_way_comparable&lt;strong_ordering&gt;</tt> should be added to <sref ref="[iterator.concept.winc]"/>/8.

The upcoming revision <paper num="P2393R1"/> will provide additional wording to solve this issue.
