<title>Do not require <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> to support non-referenceable function types</title>

<p>
[refwrap] says that <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a "wrapper around a reference to an object or function of type <tt>T</tt>" 
but this doesn't actually constrain it, and doesn't forbid non-referenceable function types like <tt>int() const</tt>.
<p/>
There is no way to construct a <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;</tt> but implementations are required to provide partial 
specializations for functions with <i>cv</i>-qualifiers and ref-qualifiers in order to define a nested <tt>result_type</tt>. 
It should be undefined to instantiate <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> with a non-referenceable type, or with a reference type 
(since references to references are not possible). Making it undefined (rather than ill-formed or unspecified) means implementations 
are not required to diagnose such invalid specializations, but also don't have to go to the effort of supporting weak result types etc.

<note>2019-03-15; Daniel comments and provides revised wording</note>
<p>
The current wording is now far behind the working draft and a synchronization is therefore recommended. In particular, with the
acceptance of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0357r1">P0357R1</a>, the specification of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> has no longer any
<i>weak result type</i>. Second, I would like to concur with a <a href="http://lists.isocpp.org/lib/2017/12/5023.php">remark 
from Tomasz</a> to change the wording to replace the undefined behavior by an ill-formed program instead, because <em>every</em>
attempt to instantiate the definition of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> will instantiate its member declarations, and this would
cause the program to become ill-formed anyway because of the illegal formation of references to non-referenceable function 
types for member functions such as <tt>T&amp; get() const noexcept</tt>.
<p/>
As concrete wording suggestion I would recommend wording that ensures that an ill-formed program is only required when a
specialization of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated, because in the absence of a constrained template parameter
we shouldn't require implementations to diagnose even forming the name of a <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> specialization such 
as in the following example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
using X = reference_wrapper&lt;int() const&gt;;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The wording below does not take advantage of a <i>Mandates:</i> element to prevent a dependency on LWG <iref ref="3193"/>
and because such an element is rarely used to specify class templates. If the committee wishes to use such an element, 
the equivalent wording would be:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<i>Mandates:</i> <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated with a referenceable type (<sref ref="[defns.referenceable]"/>) 
as the argument for the template parameter <tt>T</tt>.
</p></blockquote>

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4800">N4800</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[refwrap]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a <i>Cpp17CopyConstructible</i> and <i>Cpp17CopyAssignable</i> wrapper around a reference
to an object or function of type <tt>T</tt>. <ins>If <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> is instantiated with a non-referenceable type 
(<sref ref="[defns.referenceable]"/>) as the argument for the template parameter <tt>T</tt>, the program is ill-formed.</ins>
<p/>
-2- <tt>reference_wrapper&lt;T&gt;</tt> is a trivially copyable type (<sref ref="[basic.types]"/>).
<p/>
-3- The template parameter <tt>T</tt> of <tt>reference_wrapper</tt> may be an incomplete type.
