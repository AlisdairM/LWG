<p>
I am concerned by the wording around <tt>atomic&lt;T&gt;::wait()/atomic&lt;T&gt;::notify_one()</tt>.
<p/>
<sref ref="[atomics.wait]"/> p4 requires that the thread that calls <tt>wait()</tt> observed a
value <tt>X</tt> prior to the value <tt>Y</tt> which results from a store that happens-before 
the notify in order to be eligible to be unlocked.
<p/>
I am not sure how to implement that.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
atomic&lt;int&gt; a = 0;

T1: int ra=a, read 0
T1: a.wait(0)
T2: a=42
T3: int ra=a, read 42
T3: a.wait(42)
T2: a.notify_one()
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
The wording requires that <tt>T1</tt> is eligible to be unlocked, but not <tt>T3</tt>, as
there is not a write <em>after</em> the value read by <tt>T3</tt> that happens-before
the notify.
<p/>
However, both <tt>T1</tt> and <tt>T3</tt> are waiting, so <tt>T3</tt> may be woken by the OS.
Waking <tt>T3</tt> is allowed (<tt>wait()</tt> says it may wake spuriously), but waking <tt>T1</tt>
is currently required as it is the only thread "eligible to be unblocked".
<p/>
This requires <tt>notify_one()</tt> to wake <em>all</em> waiters, which defeats the purpose.
<p/>
I suspect we need to change <sref ref="[atomics.wait]"/> p4.
<p/>
How about:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"A call to an atomic waiting operation <tt>W</tt> on an atomic object <tt>M</tt> is
<i>eligible to be unlocked</i> by a call to an atomic notifying operation <tt>N</tt> on
<tt>M</tt> if
<ul>
<li><p><tt>N</tt> does not happen-before <tt>W</tt></p></li>
<li><p>There are no side effects <tt>X</tt> and <tt>Y</tt> in the modification order of <tt>M</tt> such
that <tt>N</tt> happens-before <tt>X</tt>, <tt>X</tt> precedes <tt>Y</tt> in the modification order 
of <tt>M</tt> and an atomic operation that observes the effects of <tt>Y</tt> happens-before <tt>W</tt>.</p></li>
</ul>
"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This would allow <tt>T3</tt> to be woken in the preceding example, but prevent it
being woken in the following case:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
T1: int ra=a, read 0
T1: a.wait(0)
T2: a=42
T2: a.notify_one()
T2: a=69
T3: int ra=a, read 69
T3: a.wait(69)
</pre></blockquote>
