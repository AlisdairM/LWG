<b>Addresses FI 8, GB 61</b>

<p>The class template <tt>lock_guard</tt> was made variadic. This is abi-breaking, and confusing because one-argument <tt>lock_guard</tt>s have a typedef <tt>mutex_type</tt> but <tt>lock_guard</tt>s with more than one argument don’t. There’s no need to try to shoehorn this functionality into one type.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Revert the changes to <tt>lock_guard</tt>, and introduce a new variadic class template <tt>vlock_guard</tt> that doesn’t have the mutex_type typedef at all.</p>

<note>Marshall notes: (3-Feb-2017)</note>>
<p>This was the subject of intense discussion in Issaquah, and a joint LEG/LEWG session agreed on this approach.</p>
