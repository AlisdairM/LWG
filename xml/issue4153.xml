<p>
There is a typo in `philox_engine` wording that makes "-1" two times
instead of one for `max()` method.
The reason for that typo is that the wording was originally inspired by
`mersenne_twister_engine` but after getting feedback that what is written in
the `philox_engine` synopsis is not C++ code, the authors introduced the
<i>m</i> variable (as in `subtract_with_carry_engine`) but forgot to remove
"-1" in the <i>m</i> definition.
</p>
<p>
Note: after the proposed resolution below is applied the <i>m</i> variable
could be reused in other places: basically in all places where the `mod  2^w`
pattern appears (like `subtract_with_carry_engine` does).
The authors don’t think it’s worth changing the rest of the wording to reuse
the <i>m</i> variable.
If somebody thinks otherwise, please provide such feedback.

<blockquote>
-1-
A `philox_engine` random number engine produces unsigned integer random numbers
in the <del>closed</del> interval [0, <i>m</i><del>]</del><ins>)</ins>,
where <i>m</i> = 2<sup><i>w</i></sup><del> − 1</del>
and the template parameter <i>w</i> defines the range of the produced numbers.
