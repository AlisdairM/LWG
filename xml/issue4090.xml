There are <tt>std::format</tt> variants that take an explicit <tt>std::locale</tt> parameter.
There is the <tt>"L"</tt> format specifier that uses that locale (or some environment
locale) for formatting, according to <sref ref="[format.string.std]"/> p17:

"For integral types, the locale-specific form causes the context's locale to
be used to insert the appropriate digit group separator characters."
</p>

It is unclear which specific facets are used to make this happen.
This is important, because users can install their own facets into
a given locale. Specific questions include:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Is <tt>num_put&lt;&gt;</tt> being used? Or just <tt>numpunct&lt;&gt;</tt>?</p></li>
<li><p> Are any of the <tt>_byname</tt> facets being used?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>
Assuming the encoding for <tt>char</tt> is UTF-8, the use of a user-provided
<tt>num_put&lt;&gt;</tt> facet (as opposed to <tt>std::format</tt> creating the output based on
<tt>numpunct&lt;&gt;</tt>) would allow digit separators that are not expressibly as a
single UTF-8 code unit.
