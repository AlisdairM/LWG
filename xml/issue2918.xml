<p>There is a surprising sequential operation applying <tt>BinaryOp1</tt> in <tt>inner_product</tt> that may, for example, 
require additional storage for the parallel algorithms to enable effective distribution of work, and is likely to be a 
performance bottleneck. <tt><i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i></tt> is probably intended here for the parallel version of the algorithm, 
with the corresponding strengthening on constraints on <tt>BinaryOp1</tt> to allow arbitrary order of evaluation.</p>
<p>Proposed change: For the overloads taking an execution policy, copy the current specification, but replace algorithm in 
<i>Effects</i> with</p>
<blockquote><pre>
<i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i>(plus&lt;&gt;(), init, multiplies&lt;&gt;(*i1, *i2), ...)
<i>GENERALIZED_SUM</i>(binary_op1, init, binary_op2(*i1, *i2), ...)
</pre></blockquote>
