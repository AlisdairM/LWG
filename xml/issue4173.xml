<p>
The Containers clause often uses "references, pointers, or iterators" which
is verbose, and needs to be said in full whenever talking about iterator
invalidation. It would be helpful to have a term of art that refers to all
of them, something like "element references" or to avoid any confusion with
actual references, "element indicators". Maybe "element handles" but that
could be confused with node handles for associative containers, and
(based on Wikipedia) has connotations of additional indirection, and something
which would <i>not</i> be invalidated when the underlying storage changes.
