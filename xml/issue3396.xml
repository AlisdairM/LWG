<p><b>Addresses <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/167">DE 169</a></b></p>
<p>
The expectation of the note that a default argument expression
involving current() causes a source_location to be constructed
that refers to the site of a function call where that default
argument is needed has no basis in normative text.
In particular, 9.2.3.6 paragraph 5 seems to imply that the
name "current" and its semantics are bound where it appears
lexically in the function declaration.
<p/>
Proposed change:
<p/>
Add normative text to express the desired semantics.

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to <a href="https://wg21.link/n4849">N4849</a>.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Modify <sref ref="[support.srcloc.cons]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
static consteval source_location current() noexcept;
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- [&hellip;]
<p/>
-2- <i>Remarks:</i> When a default member initializer is used to initialize a non-static data member, any calls to
<tt>current</tt> should correspond to the location of the constructor or aggregate initialization that initializes
the member. <ins>Any calls to <tt>current</tt> that appear as a default argument (<sref ref="[dcl.fct.default]"/>), or as a 
subexpression thereof, should correspond to the location of the invocation of the function that uses the default 
argument (<sref ref="[expr.call]"/>).</ins>
<p/>
<del>-3- [<i>Note:</i> When used as a default argument (<sref ref="[dcl.fct.default]"/>), the value of the 
<tt>source_location</tt> will be the location of the call to <tt>current</tt> at the call site. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</del>
