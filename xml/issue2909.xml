<b>Addresses US 14</b>

<p>A user specialization of any <tt>is_execution_policy</tt> should produce an ill-formed program, not merely one whose behavior is unspecified. See also the related comment re [meta.type.synop] (20.15.2). (US 10)</p>
<p>Proposed change: Reword the paragraph as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>Unless otherwise specified, a program that adds specializations for <tt>is_execution_policy</tt> is ill-formed; 
no diagnostic required.</p></blockquote>

See also LWG <iref ref="2871"/>.

<p>Jonathan: This breaks all known implementations of parallel algorithms, since they use custom execution policies.</p>
<p>Alisdair to check with SG1 to see if that's what they meant.</p>
