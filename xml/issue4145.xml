<p>
It's unclear how <sref ref="[res.on.data.races]"/> applies to templated functions that 
invoke user-supplied operations. In particular, there's no way to meet those requirements 
when a user-supplied operation can perform arbitrary operations.
<p/>
Perhaps we need to exclude the invocation of such operations from the scope of the requirements.
