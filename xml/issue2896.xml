<b>Addresses GB 57</b>

<p>The contents of <tt>&lt;codecvt&gt;</tt> are underspecified, and will take a reasonable amount of work to identify and correct all of the issues. There appears to be a general feeling that this is not the best way to address unicode transcoding in the first place, and this library component should be retired to Annex D, along side <tt>&lt;strstream&gt;</tt>, until a suitable replacement is standardized</p>

<p>Proposed change: Deprecate and move the whole of clause 22.5 [locale.stdcvt] to Annex D.</p>
