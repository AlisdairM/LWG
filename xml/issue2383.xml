<sref ref="[time.duration.literals]"/> p3 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
If any of these suffixes are applied to an integer literal and the
resulting <tt>chrono::duration</tt> value cannot be represented in the result
type because of overflow, the program is ill-formed.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Ill-formed requires a diagnostic at compile-time, but there is no way
to  detect the overflow from <tt>unsigned long long</tt> to the <tt>signed
duration&lt;&gt;::rep</tt> type.
<p/>
Overflow could be detected if the duration integer literals were
literal operator templates, otherwise overflow can either be undefined
or a run-time error, not ill-formed.
