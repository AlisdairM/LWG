<p>
The requirements on the <tt>stateT</tt> type used 
to instantiate class template <tt>fpos</tt> are not 
clear, and the following Table 108 &mdash; "Position 
type requirements" is a bit of a mess. This is 
old wording, and should be cleaned up with better
terminology from the Clause 17 Requirements. For example, 
<tt>stateT</tt> might be require <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>?, 
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt>?, and <tt>Destructible</tt>. Several 
entries in the final column of the table appear to be 
post-conditions, but without the <tt>post</tt> markup to 
clarify they are not assertions or preconditions. They 
frequently refer to identifiers that do not apply to all 
entries in their corresponding <tt>Expression</tt> 
column, leaving some expressions without a clearly defined semantic.
If <tt>stateT</tt> is a trivial type, is <tt>fpos</tt> also a 
trivial type, or is a default constructor not required/supported?

<p>
Proposed change:
<p/>
Clarify the requirements and the table.
