<p>
Some of our newer wording for C++20 uses the term "decayed type" as if it were 
a defined term of art.  While I have intuition for what may be intended in these 
cases, it turns out the "function to function pointer decay" and "array to array 
pointer decay" where never actually Core terms of art &mdash; having searched all 
standards going back as far as C++03.
<p/>
We should either define this term for library use, or find a way to state
our intent using existing well-defined terms of art.
<p/>
Affected clauses:
<p/>
<ul>
<li><p><sref ref="[cmp.alg]"/>: Most heavily used here.</p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[range.all.general]"/></p></li>
<li><p><sref ref="[cmp.alg]"/></p></li>
</ul>
