<p>
The `packaged_task` move assignment operator is specified to release
the previous shared state. This means it releases ownership, but does
not make the shared state ready. Any future that shares ownership of the
shared state will never receive a result, because the provider is gone.
This means that any thread that waits on the future will block forever.
</p>
<p>
There is a note on `packaged_task::reset()` which claims that assignment
abandons the state, which is not supported by any normative wording:
</p>
<blockquote>
<pre>void reset();</pre>
<p>
-26- <i>Effects</i>:
As if `*this = packaged_task(std::move(f))`,
where `f` is the task stored in `*this`.
</p>
<p>
[<i>Note 2</i>:â€‚This constructs a new shared state for `*this`.
The old state is abandoned (<sref ref="[futures.state]"/>).
&mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Presumably, the intended behaviour of assignment was to abandon the
shared state,
i.e.  make it ready with a `broken_promise` error, and then release it.
That is what the `std::promise` move assignment does
(see <sref ref="[futures.promise]"/> p9).
Both libstdc++ and libc++ abandon the state, despite what the standard says.
