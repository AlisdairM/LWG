<sref ref="[container.requirements.general]"/>/10 says that unless otherwise specified, "no <tt>swap()</tt> function invalidates 
any references, pointers, or iterators referring to the elements of the containers being swapped. [<i>Note:</i> The <tt>end()</tt> 
iterator does not refer to any element, so it may be invalidated. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]". However, move constructors and move 
assignment operators aren't given similar invalidation guarantees. The guarantees need several exceptions, so I do not believe 
that blanket language like /11 "Unless otherwise specified (either explicitly or by defining a function in terms of other functions), 
invoking a container member function or passing a container as an argument to a library function shall not invalidate iterators to, 
or change the values of, objects within that container." is applicable.

<p>
General agreeement on intent, several wording nits and additional paragraphs to hit.
</p>
<p>
STL to provide updated wording.  Move to Open.

AM: in the proposed wording, I'd like to mention that the iterators now refer to elements of a different container. 
I think we're saying something like this somewhere. JY: There's some wording like that for swap I think. TK: It's also in 
<tt>list::splice()</tt>. DK to JY: 23.2.1p9.
<p/>
VV: The issue says that STL was going to propose new wording. Has he done that? AM: I believe we're looking at that. 
GR: The request touches on multiple paragraphs, and this PR has only one new paragraph, so this looks like it's not up-to-date. 
MC: This was last updated a year ago in Issaquah.
<p/>
<b>Conclusion</b>: Skip, not up to date.

<p>This wording is relative to N3691.</p>

-10- Unless otherwise specified (see 23.2.4.1, 23.2.5.1, 23.3.3.4, and 23.3.7.5) all container types defined in this
