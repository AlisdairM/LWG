<p>
In Oulu, we adopted <a href="https://wg21.link/p0063r3">P0063r3</a> to base C++ on C11. C11 is the first version 
of C that defines a header <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>. However, C++11 (!) already seems to have defined headers 
<tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>, even though C99 does not have <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>.
<p/>
This appears to be the consequence of the partial application of N3093 from 2010, which proposes both to add 
<tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> and to rebase C++ onto C11. However, the latter part didn't happen, leaving the header 
dangling without a sensible specification.
<p/>
I suggest two actions:
</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: none">
<li>1) Recognize that C++11 and C++14 are defective in mentioning <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt>.</li>

<li>2a) Consequently, P0063r3 is <em>adding</em> <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> as a new feature; I would like to revert that 
decision and not add this header. Instead, P0063r3 should <em>only</em> add <tt>&lt;stdalign.h&gt;</tt> (which should 
be done in Annex D) for compatibility with C.</li>

<li>2b) If we do not want to un-add <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt>, we should at least put the specification of <tt>&lt;cstdalign&gt;</tt> into Annex D.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Moreover, I would like to ask LWG for editorial dispensation to move the specifications of <tt>&lt;ccomplex&gt;</tt>, 
<tt>&lt;ctgmath&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;cstdbool&gt;</tt> wholly into Annex D, too, since these are now deprecated features that are not otherwise referred to or needed by the main text. An example change is available 
<a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/1054">on github</a>, which incorporates solution 2b. 
Wording for solution 2a can be produced on request.
