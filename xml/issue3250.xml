We have:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"For floating-point numbers, the alternate form causes the result of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
So does that mean that infinity is formatted as <tt>"inf."</tt> and NaN as <tt>"nan."</tt>? (Or 
something like that? Where exactly do we add the decimal point in this case?) Or does this 
affect infinity but not NaN (because we can handwave that a NaN value is not a 
"floating-point number")?
<p/>
I suspect that this should only cover finite floating-point numbers.

Right. So infinity and NaN should be still formatted as <tt>"inf"</tt> and <tt>"nan"</tt> 
without a decimal point.

<p>
[&hellip;] For <ins>finite</ins> floating-point numbers the alternate form causes the result 
of the conversion to always contain a decimal-point character, even if no digits follow it. [&hellip;]
