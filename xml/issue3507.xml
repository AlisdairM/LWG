<p>
The specification of <sref ref="[stacktrace.entry.query]"/> uses the terms "presumed or actual name 
of the source file" and "actual line number". It makes reference to <sref ref="[cpp.predefined]"/>, 
which introduces the term "presumed". It does not clearly define the term, but it describes how the 
presumed values can be modified with preprocessor directives. However, there is no definition whatsoever 
of "actual".
<p/>
The term should either be defined, or we should strike the "actual" parts of the stacktrace wording. 
We should consult implementers about this.
<p/>
I don't have a proposed resolution, but if we want to keep "actual", then perhaps we should define 
both "presumed" and "actual" in <sref ref="[cpp.predefined]"/>.

Set priority to 2 following reflector and telecon discussions.

<p>
We want to know the original intended meaning of "actual line number" here.
Presumably debuginfo stored in binaries uses a real line number in the source,
not one that might have been set by a <tt>#line</tt> directive.
The "presumed or actual" wording was added in R2 of the paper, possibly
as a result of LWG review.
