<p>
For forward iterators we have very clear wording regarding the restricted domain of <tt>operator==</tt>
in <sref ref="[forward.iterators]"/> p2:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The domain of <tt>==</tt> for forward iterators is that of iterators over the same underlying sequence. 
However, value-initialized iterators may be compared and shall compare equal to other value-initialized 
iterators of the same type. [<i>Note:</i> Value-initialized iterators behave as if they refer past the 
end of the same empty sequence. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
But for the relational operators of random access iterators specified in 
<sref ref="[random.access.iterators]"/>, Table <sref ref="[tab:randomaccessiterator]"/>,
no such domain constraints are clearly defined, except that we can infer that they are
similarly constrained as the difference of the compared iterators by means of the
operational semantics of <tt>operator&lt;</tt>.
