<p>
Both <tt>std::pmr::new_delete_resource</tt> and <tt>std::pmr::null_memory_resource</tt> return pointers 
to static-duration objects. It seems unspecified when the pointed-to objects are destroyed, so users can't 
reliably use these objects during destructions of their static-duration objects.
<p/>
<tt>std::generic_category</tt> and <tt>std::system_category</tt> have the same issue, except that the 
referred-to objects may have different storage duration.
<p/>
Should we specify in which case can these objects be used in the termination of a program?
