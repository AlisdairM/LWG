<p>
The <tt>Boolean</tt> concept was recently added to the C++20 working draft. Unfortunately, there are 
Windows platform headers that use the name "<tt>Boolean</tt>" in the global namespace. Programs that import 
namespace <tt>std</tt> into the global namespace via using directive &mdash; as is common in the 
Windows codebase &mdash; will be broken by the C++20 Standard Library if this name is not changed.
