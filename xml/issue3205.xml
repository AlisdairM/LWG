<p>
The <tt>Boolean</tt> concept was recently added to the C++20 working draft. Unfortunately, the name 
"<tt>Boolean</tt>" is commonly defined as a macro in the Windows codebase. There are a few dozen 
occurrences of "<tt>#define Boolean</tt>" in ACTCD19, so this issue exists to a lesser extent in 
other code as well. Using "<tt>Boolean</tt>" as the name of the concept will inhibit adoption in 
code that uses such a macro definition.
