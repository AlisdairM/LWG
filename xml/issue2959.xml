<p>
The standard requires that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::int_type</tt> is
<tt>uint_least16_t</tt>, so when that has the same representation as <tt>char16_t</tt>
there are no bits left to represent the <tt>eof</tt> value.
<p/>
<sref ref="[char.traits.specializations.char16_t]"/> says:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
&mdash; The member <tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant
that cannot appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Existing practice is to use the "noncharacter" <tt>u'\uffff'</tt> for this
value, but the Unicode spec is clear that <tt>U+FFFF</tt> and other
noncharacters are valid, and their appearance in a UTF-16 string does
not make it ill-formed. See <a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar7">here</a> and
<a href="http://www.unicode.org/faq/private_use.html#nonchar8">here</a>:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>The fact that they are called "noncharacters" and are not intended for open interchange does not mean 
that they are somehow illegal or invalid code points which make strings containing them invalid.</i>
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In practice this means there's no way to tell if
<tt>basic_streambuf&lt;char16_t&gt;::sputc(u'\uffff')</tt> succeeded or not. If it
can insert the character it returns <tt>to_int_type(u'\uffff')</tt> and
otherwise it returns <tt>eof()</tt>, which is the same value.
<p/>
I believe that <tt>char_traits&lt;char16_t&gt;::to_int_type(char_type c)</tt> can be
defined to transform <tt>U+FFFF</tt> into <tt>U+FFFD</tt>, so that the invariant
<tt>eq_int_type(eof(), to_int_type(c)) == false</tt> holds for any <tt>c</tt> (and the
return value of <tt>sputc</tt> will be distinct from <tt>eof</tt>). I don't think any
implementation currently meets that invariant.
<p/>
I think at the very least we need to correct the statement "The member
<tt>eof()</tt> shall return an implementation-defined constant that cannot
appear as a valid UTF-16 code unit", because there are no such
constants if <tt>sizeof(uint_least16_t) == sizeof(char16_t)</tt>.
<p/>
This issue is closely related to LWG <iref ref="1200"/>, but there it's a
slightly different statement of the problem, and neither the
submitter's recommendation nor the proposed resolution solves this
issue here. It seems that was closed as NAD before the Unicode corrigendum
existed, so at the time our standard just gave "surprising results"
but wasn't strictly wrong. Now it makes a normative statement that
conflicts with Unicode.
