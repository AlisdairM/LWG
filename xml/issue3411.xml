<p><b>Addresses: fund.ts.v3</b></p>
<p>
The Library Fundamentals TS, <a href="http://wg21.link/n4840">N4840</a>, 
contains <a href="http://wg21.link/n4840#general.namespaces">a rule about 
the use of namespaces (paragraph 1)</a>, with the consequence:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This TS does not define <tt>std::experimental::fundamentals_v3::pmr</tt>"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, the TS then <a href="http://wg21.link/n4840#memory.resource.syn">goes on to 
define exactly that namespace</a>.
<p/>
At the time when the subclause memory.resource.syn was added, the IS didn't use to contain 
a namespace <tt>pmr</tt>. When the IS adopted that namespace and the TS was rebased, the 
namespace rule started conflicting with the material in the TS.
<p/>
I do not have a workable proposed resolution at this point.
