<p>In Morristown we changed the <code>size_type</code> and <code>difference_type</code> typedefs
for all the other containers to implementation defined with a
reference to <sref ref="[container.requirements]"/>.  This should probably also have been
done for strings. </p>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect.  [Originally classified as a defect, later
reclassified.]  <code>basic_string</code>, unlike the other standard library
template containers, is severely constrained by its use of
<code>char_traits</code>. Those types are dictated by the traits class, and are far
from implementation defined.</p>
