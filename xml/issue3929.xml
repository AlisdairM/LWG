<p>
Since we have adopted the <i>Constraints</i>/<i>Mandates</i>/<i>Preconditions</i> form of wording,
"preconditions" refer to runtime requirements, not compile-time.  As such, the
column labeled "preconditions" in Table 47: Type property predicates [tab:meta.unary.prop]
would be better labeled as "Mandates".
<p/>
This is an LWG issue and not editorial, and "Mandates" would require the library
to diagnose violations, but after reviewing all traits in this table, I believe that is
reasonable.
<p/>
Table 48: Type property queries [tab:meta.unary.prop.query] shows how <i>Mandates:</i>
elements can be integrated into the "Value" column if we preferred that approach, but for the
number of entries in the first table seems like an aggressive change for consistency.
<p/>
Similarly, for Table 49: Type relationship predicates [tab:meta.rel] the "Comments"
column serves as a "Mandates" feature without using that term, so I suggest changing
that column title too.
<p/>
The other tables and type traits wording already appear to be adapted to the Mandates
wording style.

<p>
This wording is relative to <paper num="N4944"/>.

<ol>
<li>
<p>Change in <sref ref="[meta.unary.comp]"/>, Table 47: Type property predicates [tab:meta.unary.prop] 
the column title "<b>Preconditions</b>" to "<b>Mandates</b>".</p>
</li>

<li>
<p>Change in <sref ref="[meta.rel]"/>, Table 49: Type relationship predicates [tab:meta.rel] the column 
title "<b>Comments</b>" to "<b>Mandates</b>".</p>
</li>

</ol>
