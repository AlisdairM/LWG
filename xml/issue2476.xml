<title><tt>scoped_allocator_adaptor</tt> is not assignable</title>

<discussion>
<p>
The class definition in <sref ref="[allocator.adaptor.syn]"/> declares a move
constructor, which means that the copy assignment operator is defined
as deleted, and no move assignment operator is declared.
<p/>
This means a <tt>scoped_allocator_adaptor</tt> is not assignable, and a
container using <tt>scoped_allocator_adaptor&lt;A...&gt;</tt> may not be
<tt>CopyAssignable</tt> or <tt>MoveAssignable</tt> (depending on the
<tt>propagate_on_container_xxxx_assignment</tt> traits of the outer and inner
allocator types).

<resolution>
<p>This wording is relative to N4296.</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>Add to the synopsis in <sref ref="[allocator.adaptor.syn]"/>/1 [<i>Editorial remark</i>: The proposed wording
does not explicitly specify the semantics of the added copy/move assignment operators, based on 
<sref ref="[functions.within.classes]"/> p1, which says:
<p/>
"For the sake of exposition, Clauses 18 through 30 and Annex D do not describe copy/move constructors,
assignment operators, or (non-virtual) destructors with the same apparent semantics as those that can be
generated by default (12.1, 12.4, 12.8)."
