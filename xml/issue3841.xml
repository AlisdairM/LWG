<p>
It's reasonable for the <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> header to be required for freestanding, 
so that users can include it and see the "implementation-dependent information &hellip; 
(e.g. version number and release date)", and also to ask which features are present 
(which is the real intended purpose of <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt>). 
It seems less reasonable to require every macro to be present on freestanding implementations, 
even the ones that correspond to non-freestanding features.
<p/>
<paper num="P2198R7"/> will fix this situation for C++26, but we should also do something for 
C++23 before publishing it. 
It seems sensible not to require any of the macros to be present, and then allow implementations 
to define them for the features that they support.

<p>
-2- Each of the macros defined in <tt>&lt;version&gt;</tt> is also defined after inclusion of any member 
of the set of library headers indicated in the corresponding comment in this synopsis.
<p/>
[<i>Note 1</i>: Future revisions of C++ might replace the values of these macros with greater values. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
