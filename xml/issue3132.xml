<title>Library needs to ban macros named <tt>expects</tt> or <tt>ensures</tt></title>

<p>
<tt>expects</tt> and <tt>ensures</tt> are not technically described as <i>attribute-tokens</i> when used 
in a <i>contract-attribute-specifier</i>, so the existing prohibition in <sref ref="[macro.names]"/>
doesn't apply to them.
<p/>
The remaining special identifiers used by the contract attributes are all already covered by existing wording:
<tt>assert</tt> is also a library name so falls under p1, <tt>default</tt> is a keyword, and both <tt>axiom</tt>
and <tt>audit</tt> were added to Table 4.
</p>

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4750">N4750</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Change <sref ref="[macro.names]"/> p2 as indicated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-2- A translation unit shall not <tt>#define</tt> or <tt>#undef</tt> names lexically identical to keywords,
to the identifiers listed in Table 4, <del>or</del> to the <i>attribute-tokens</i> described in <sref ref="[dcl.attr]"/><ins>,
or to the identifiers <tt>expects</tt> or <tt>ensures</tt></ins>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
</resolution>
