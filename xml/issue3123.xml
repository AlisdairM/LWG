<title><tt>duration</tt> constructor from representation shouldn't be effectively non-throwing</title>

[time.duration]/4 states:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
Members of duration shall not throw exceptions other than those thrown by the indicated operations on their representations.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Where representation is defined in the non-normative, brief description at [time.duration]/1:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[&hellip;] A duration has a representation which holds a count of ticks and a tick period. [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
[time.duration.cons]/2 doesn't indicate the operation undergone by its representation, merely stating a postcondition in [time.duration.cons]/3:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of type <tt>duration</tt>.
<p/>
<i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>count() == static_cast&lt;rep&gt;(r)</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I suggest this reformulation that follows the format of [time.duration.cons]/5.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of type duration, constructing <tt>rep_</tt> from <tt>r</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Now it is clear why the constructor would throw.

<resolution>
<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4750">N4750</a>.
</p>


<p>Change <sref ref="[time.duration.cons]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<pre>
template&lt;class Rep2&gt;
  constexpr explicit duration(const Rep2&amp; r);
</pre>
<blockquote>
<p>
-1- <i>Remarks:</i> This constructor shall not participate in overload resolution unless [&hellip;]
<p/>
-2- <i>Effects:</i> Constructs an object of type <tt>duration</tt><ins>, constructing <tt>rep_</tt> from <tt>r</tt></ins>.
<p/>
-3- <i>Postconditions:</i> <tt>count() == static_cast&lt;rep&gt;(r)</tt>.
</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
</resolution>
