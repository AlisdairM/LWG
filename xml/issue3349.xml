<a href="https://wg21.link/p1902r1">P1902R1</a> "Missing feature-test macros 2017-2019", accepted in Belfast, said:
</p>
<blockquote style="border-left: 3px solid #ccc;padding-left: 15px;">
<p>
[<a href="https://wg21.link/p0415r1">P0415R1</a>] (Constexpr for <tt>std::complex</tt>): this paper proposes to 
introduce the macro <tt>__cpp_lib_constexpr_complex</tt>. That is, introducing a new macro for this header.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
However, <tt>__cpp_lib_constexpr_complex</tt> wasn't mentioned in the Wording section, and doesn't appear 
in the latest WP <a href="https://wg21.link/n4842">N4842</a>.
<p/>
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0415r1">P0415R1</a> was accepted in Albuquerque (November 2017), and the paper itself 
said "For the purposes of SG10, we recommend the feature-testing macro name <tt>__cpp_lib_constexpr_complex</tt>.", 
so this has been accepted and then overlooked by WG21 twice.
