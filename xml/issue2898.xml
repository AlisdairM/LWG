<p>Review the whole library for constructors using member typedefs to name constructor parameters rather than template type parameters, as this inhibits class template deduction. e.g., the <tt>unique_lock</tt> explicit constructor taking the <tt>mutex_type</tt> typedef would be better served naming <tt>Mutex</tt> directly, to preserve support for deduction.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Review each constructor of each library class template, and revise specification of parameter types as needed.</p>
