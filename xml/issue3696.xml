Raised from editorial issue <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/5240">#5240</a>.
<p/>
The phrase "signed basic integral types" in <sref ref="[stream.types]"/> has been present since C++98 but 
never defined. It is unclear whether "basic integral types" are "standard integer types" or "integer types" 
(including extended integer types).
<p/>
As <tt>std::streamoff</tt> should be wide enough to represent the largest possible file size, and 
<tt>std::uintmax_t</tt> is used as the return type of <tt>std::filesystem::file_size</tt>, we should not 
disallow <tt>std::streamoff</tt> to be an extended integer type which may be wider than <tt>long long</tt>. 
On the other hand, as <tt>std::size_t</tt> and <tt>std::ptrdiff_t</tt> have already been allowed to be 
extended integer types, <tt>std::streamsize</tt> should also be allowed to be an extended integer type for consistency.
<p/>
So I think we should just use "signed integer types" instead of "signed basic integral types" in 
<sref ref="[stream.types]"/>.
