<sref ref="[time.format]"/>/3:
<blockquote>
If the formatted object does not contain the information the conversion
specifier refers to, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
</blockquote>

<sref ref="[time.format]"/>/6:
<blockquote>
If the type being formatted does not contain the information that the format
flag needs, an exception of type <tt>format_error</tt> is thrown.
</blockquote>
</p>

<p>
It's unclear how to determine if a type contain the needed information,
and implementations diverge.
</p>

<p>
For example, consider
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;chrono&gt;
#include &lt;format&gt;

auto f(std::chrono::month_day_last mdl) {
  return std::format("{:%j}", mdl);
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Both libstdc++ and libc++ produce a compile-time error, claiming that the
argument does not contain the information, while MSVC STL throws
<tt>format_error</tt> at run time unless <tt>mdl</tt> is `January/last`,
in which case the function returns "031".
</p>
<p>
Another interesting case is <code>format("{:%d}", mdl)</code> where the value
can be printed for all months <i>except</i> February, which requires a year
to know how many days it has.
</p>

<p>
A related example from Jonathan Wakely:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::chrono::weekday_indexed wdi(Monday, 7);  // 7th Monday in the month
assert( ! wdi.ok() );
assert( wdi.weekday().ok() );
std::format("{:%a}", wdi);
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
For <tt>%a</tt> the required information is "a valid weekday",
and arguably this does contain a valid weekday.
On the other hand, there's no 7th Monday, so this isn't valid.
Should this throw or not?
</p>
<p>
This was discussed by LWG and Howard Hinnant summarized the intended behaviour as:
<blockquote>
"The intention of <sref ref="[time.format]"/>/6 is to address things like
formatting a <tt>duration</tt> with <tt>%F</tt>. A <tt>duration</tt> doesn't contain
the calendrical information that <tt>%F</tt> requires (year, month, day).
Ditto for using <tt>%a</tt> (weekday name) with a <tt>year</tt>.
It is meant to address mismatching <i>types</i> and flags,
and not meant to address <i>values</i>."
</blockquote>
</p>
<p>
The type <tt>chrono::weekday</tt> does contain the information needed to print
a weekday. A specific invalid value doesn't change that.
The type <tt>chrono::month_day_last</tt> does not contain the information
needed to print the day of the year.
A specific value where the day can be known doesn't change that.
The day of month is more interesting, and might need more discussion.
</p>
<p>
Jonathan proposed adding more examples to clarify the intention that only the
type matters, and not the value. There is some redundancy between p3 and p6.
Referring to "the formatted object" in p3 seems unclear.
Saying "type" as in p6 is better.
But p6 refers to "format flag" which is not defined,
whereas p3 uses "conversion specifier" (defined at the start of that paragraph).
The two uses of "flag" in p6 look like remnants from the earlier <tt>chrono::format</tt> 
feature that was replaced by integration with <tt>std::format</tt>.

<li>
<p>Modify <sref ref="[time.format]"/> as indicated:</p>

<blockquote>
<p> -3-
Each conversion specifier <i>conversion-spec</i> is replaced by appropriate
characters as described in Table 101 ([tab:time.format.spec]);
the formats specified in ISO 8601:2004 shall be used where so described.
Some of the conversion specifiers depend on the formatting locale.
If the string literal encoding is a Unicode encoding form and
the locale is among an implementation-defined set of locales,
each replacement that depends on the locale is performed as if
the replacement character sequence is converted to the string literal encoding.
If the <del>formatted object</del><ins>type being formatted</ins>
does not contain the information the conversion specifier refers to,
an exception of type <code>format_error</code> is thrown.
</p>
<p><ins>[<i>Example ?</i>:
A <code>duration</code> does not contain enough information to format as
a weekday using <code>%w</code>.
A <code>weekday_indexed</code> does contain enough information to format
using <code>%w</code> and <code>Monday[7]</code> can be formatted as
<code>"1"</code> even though <code>Monday[7].ok()</code> is <code>false</code>.
A <code>month_day</code> does not contain enough information to format as
the day of the year using <code>%j</code>, even when the <code>month()</code>
part is <code>January</code>.
&mdash; <i>end example</i>]</ins>
</p>
<p>
<ins>
However, if a flag refers to a "time of day"
(e.g., <code>%H</code>, <code>%I</code>, <code>%p</code>, etc.),
then a specialization of <code>duration</code> is interpreted as
the time of day elapsed since midnight.
</ins>
</p>

<p> -4-
The result of formatting a <code>std::chrono::duration</code> instance
holding a negative value, or an <code>hh_mm_ss</code> object <code>h</code>
for which <code>h.is_negative()</code> is <code>true</code>,
is equivalent to the output of the corresponding positive value,
with a <code><i>STATICALLY-WIDEN</i>&lt;charT&gt;("-")</code>
character sequence placed before the replacement of the initial conversion
specifier.
</p>
<p>[<i>Example 1</i>:
<pre><code>
cout &lt;&lt; format("{:%T}", -10'000s);          // prints: -02:46:40
cout &lt;&lt; format("{:%H:%M:%S}", -10'000s);    // prints: -02:46:40
cout &lt;&lt; format("minutes {:%M, hours %H, seconds %S}", -10'000s);
                                            // prints: minutes -46, hours 02, seconds 40
</code></pre>
&mdash; <i>end example</i>]
</p>
<p> -5-
Unless explicitly requested, the result of formatting a chrono type
does not contain time zone abbreviation and time zone offset information.
If the information is available, the conversion specifiers <code>%Z</code> and
<code>%z</code> will format this information (respectively).
</p>
<p>[<i>Note 1</i>:
If the information is not available and a <code>%Z</code> or <code>%z</code>
conversion specifier appears in the <i>chrono-format-spec</i>,
an exception of type <code>format_error</code> is thrown, as described above.
&mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p>
<p> <del>-6-
If the type being formatted does not contain the information that the format flag needs,
an exception of type <code>format_error</code> is thrown, as described above.
</del>
</p>
<p><del>[<i>Example 2</i>:
A <code>duration</code> does not contain enough information to format as a
<code>weekday</code>.
&mdash; <i>end example</i>]
</del>
</p>
<p>
<del>
However, if a flag refers to a "time of day"
(e.g., <code>%H</code>, <code>%I</code>, <code>%p</code>, etc.),
then a specialization of <code>duration</code> is interpreted as
the time of day elapsed since midnight.
