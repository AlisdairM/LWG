<p>
The current library specification uses at several places wording that is intended to refer to
core language template deduction failure at the top-level of expressions (aka "SFINAE"), for example:
</p>

<blockquote><p>
The expression <tt>declval&lt;T&gt;() = declval&lt;U&gt;()</tt> is well-formed when treated as an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). 
Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>T</tt> and <tt>U</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context 
of the assignment expression is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of the expression can result in side effects 
such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function template specializations, the generation of
implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the "immediate context" and can result in the program
being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
</p></blockquote>

<p>
Similar wording can be found in the specification of <tt>result_of</tt>, <tt>is_constructible</tt>, and <tt>is_convertible</tt>,
being added to resolve an NB comment by LWG <iref ref="1390"/> and <iref ref="1391"/> through 
<a href="http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg21/docs/papers/2010/n3142.html">N3142</a>.
<p/>
This wording is necessary to limit speculative compilations needed to implement these traits, but it is also lengthy and repetitive.
</p>

<note>2014-05-19, Daniel suggests a descriptive term</note>

<p>
<b>constrictedly well-formed expression</b>:
<p/>
An expression <em>e</em> depending on a set of types <tt>A1</tt>, ..., <tt>An</tt> which is well-formed when treated as 
an unevaluated operand (Clause 5). Access checking is performed as if in a context unrelated to <tt>A1</tt>, ..., 
<tt>An</tt>. Only the validity of the immediate context of <em>e</em> is considered. [<i>Note:</i> The compilation of 
the expression can result in side effects such as the instantiation of class template specializations and function 
template specializations, the generation of implicitly-defined functions, and so on. Such side effects are not in the 
"immediate context" and can result in the program being ill-formed. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]
