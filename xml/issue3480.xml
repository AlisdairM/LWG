<p>
<tt>std::filesystem::directory_iterator</tt> and <tt>std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator</tt> are 
intended to be ranges, but both fail to satisfy the concept <tt>std::ranges::range</tt>.
<p/>
They both opt in to being a range the same way, via non-member functions:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
directory_iterator begin(directory_iterator iter) noexcept;
directory_iterator end(const directory_iterator&amp;) noexcept;

recursive_directory_iterator begin(recursive_directory_iterator iter) noexcept;
recursive_directory_iterator end(const recursive_directory_iterator&amp;) noexcept;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is good enough for a range-based for statement, but for the <tt>range</tt> concept, non-member 
<tt>end</tt> is looked up in a context that includes (<sref ref="[range.access.end]"/>/2.6) the declarations:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
void end(auto&amp;) = delete;
void end(const auto&amp;) = delete;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Which means that non-<tt>const</tt> <tt>directory_iterator</tt> and non-<tt>const</tt> 
<tt>recursive_directory_iterator</tt>, the <tt>void end(auto&amp;)</tt> overload ends up being 
a better match and thus the CPO <tt>ranges::end</tt> doesn't find a candidate. Which means that 
<tt>{recursive_,}directory_iterator</tt> is not a range, even though <tt>const {recursive_,}directory_iterator</tt> 
<em>is</em> a range.
<p/>
This could be fixed by having the non-member <tt>end</tt> for both of these types just take by value 
(as libstdc++ currently does anyway) or by adding member functions <tt>begin() const</tt> and <tt>end() const</tt>. 
<p/>
A broader direction would be to consider removing the poison pill overloads. Their motivation from 
<a href="https://wg21.link/p0970">P0970</a> was to support what are now called borrowed ranges &mdash; but 
that design now is based on specializing a variable template instead of providing a non-member <tt>begin</tt> 
that takes an rvalue, so the initial motivation simply no longer exists. And, in this particular case, 
causes harm.

<p>
When we do make whichever of the alternative adjustments necessary such that 
<tt>range&lt;directory_iterator&gt;</tt> is <tt>true</tt>, we should also remember
to specialize <tt>enable_borrowed_range</tt> for both types to be <tt>true</tt> (since
the iterator is the range, this is kind of trivially true).
