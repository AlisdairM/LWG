<title><tt>directory_entry</tt> comparisons are members</title>

<p>
The comparison operators for <tt>directory_entry</tt> are member functions
(<sref ref="[directory_entry.obs]"/>).
<p/>
That means that a <tt>directory_entry</tt> can be compared with a <tt>path</tt>,
but a <tt>path</tt> cannot be compared with a <tt>directory_entry</tt>, because
the left-hand side is not subject to conversions. This seems
unfortunate.
<p/>
Note that the comparisons for <tt>path</tt> are non-members (<sref ref="[path.non-member]"/>).
<p/>
The meta-p/r is to turn the <tt>directory_entry</tt> comparisons into non-member functions.
