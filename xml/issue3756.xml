Following document number <paper num="N4910"/> about signal-safe instructions
<sref ref="[support.signal]"/> Signal handlers, and it's unclear whether
<tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> is signal-safe.
<p/>
Formally it doesn't fit any of the mentioned conditions:
</p>
<ul>
<li><p><tt>f</tt> is a non-static member function invoked on an object <tt>A</tt>, such that
<tt>A.is_lock_free()</tt> yields <tt>true</tt>, or</p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>
(there is no <tt>is_lock_free</tt> method in <tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> class)
</p></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p><tt>f</tt> is a non-member function, and for every pointer-to-atomic argument <tt>A</tt>
passed to <tt>f</tt>, <tt>atomic_is_lock_free(A)</tt> yields <tt>true</tt></p>
<blockquote class="note"><p>
(<tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> object can't be passed to <tt>atomic_is_lock_free</tt> as argument)
</p></blockquote></li>
</ul>
<p>
However, <tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> seem to fit well here, it's atomic, and it's
always lock-free.
<p/>
The suggestion is as follows: If <tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> is signal-safe, then it
should be explicitly mentioned in <sref ref="[support.signal]"/>, e.g., the following lines
should be added:
</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p><ins><tt>f</tt> is a non-static member function invoked on an <tt>atomic_flag</tt> object, or</ins></p></li>
<li><p><ins><tt>f</tt> is a non-member function, and every pointer-to-atomic argument
passed to <tt>f</tt> is <tt>atomic_flag</tt>, or</ins></p></li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the <tt>std::atomic_flag</tt> is not signal-safe, the following note could be added:
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
<ins>[<i>Note:</i> Even though <tt>atomic_flag</tt> is atomic and lock-free, it's not signal-safe. &mdash; <i>end note</i>]</ins>
</p>
</blockquote>
