<p>
This is a small part of issues raised by already-closed <paper num="P3156"/>.
<p/>
Currently, <tt>ranges::empty</tt> (<sref ref="[range.prim.empty]"/>) is always a valid expression when applied
to <tt>forward_range</tt>s, because even if it does not have <tt>.empty()</tt> or <tt>.size()</tt> we can always
check whether it is empty by comparing its <tt>begin()</tt> and <tt>end()</tt>, which is reflected in the 
standard preference to use it to check whether a certain <tt>forward_range</tt> is empty,
such as in the <i>Effects</i> of <tt>split_view::<i>find-next</i>()</tt> (<sref ref="[range.split.view]"/>) 
and <tt>cartesian_product_view::end()</tt> (<sref ref="[range.cartesian.view]"/>).
<p/>
In addition, MSVC-STL also uses <tt>ranges::empty</tt> in the <a
href="https://github.com/microsoft/STL/blob/8e2d724cc1072b4052b14d8c5f81a830b8f1d8cb/stl/inc/algorithm#L1455">implementation</a>
of <tt>ranges::contains_subrange</tt> for the check.
<p/>
However, unlike <tt>ranges::size</tt>, which has a <tt>sized_range</tt> concept to ensure semantics,
<tt>ranges::empty</tt> has no corresponding one. This makes it lack of time complexity guarantees and semantics 
for the meaning of the returned value when using the bullets (2.2) and (2.3) of <sref ref="[range.prim.empty]"/>
to check emptiness.
<p/>
Perhaps we need to add semantic requirements for <tt>ranges::empty</tt>, but this seems
inconsistent with the current wording as no other CPOs have.
<p/>
Alternatively, maybe we could move bullets targeting <tt>forward_range</tt>s to the very beginning so that
<tt>ranges::empty</tt> always has correct semantics with <tt>bool(ranges::begin(t) == ranges::end(t))</tt> when
applied to <tt>forward_range</tt>s.
