This is from editorial issue <a href="http://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/1620">#1620</a>:
<p/>
Since the resolution of US-78 was applied (as part of <a href="http://wg21.link/p0492r2">P0492R2</a>),
<tt>std::filesystem::absolute(path, base)</tt> no longer exists. However, <tt>std::filesystem::canonical</tt> 
is still defined in terms of <tt>absolute(p, base)</tt>.
