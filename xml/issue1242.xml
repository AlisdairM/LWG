<p>
The paper was lengthy discussed but considerable concern remained to add this feature to C++0x. 
The LWG does not wish to make a change at this time. Strong consensus was found to consider 
it for C++1x, though.

<p>Status to NAD; Alisdair to provide rationale.</p>

<rationale>
Insufficient motivation to make a change now. This is existing practice in the major implementations, and 
they are motivated to do this even if not mandated to do so, because it improves compilation time which 
benefits their users. If the issue submitter feels strongly about this they are invited to write an
updated paper with suggested wording to mandate it.
