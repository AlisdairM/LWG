The <tt>in_place</tt> constructors and <tt>emplace</tt> functions
added by <a href="http://wg21.link/p0032r3">P0032R3</a> don't require <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
They must. Otherwise copying an <tt>any</tt> that's made to hold a non-<tt>CopyConstructible</tt>
type must fail with a run-time error. Since that's crazy, we want to prevent
storing non-<tt>CopyConstructible</tt> types in an <tt>any</tt>.
<p/>
Previously, the requirement for <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> was just on the converting
constructor template and the converting assignment operator template on <tt>any</tt>.
Now that we are adding two <tt>in_place</tt> constructor overloads and two
<tt>emplace</tt> overloads, it seems reasonable to require <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> in some more 
general location, in order to avoid repeating that requirement all over the place.
