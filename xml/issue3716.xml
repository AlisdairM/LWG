<p>
There are two different definitions of multi-pass guarantee since <paper num="P0896R4"/>. The old one (perhaps 
introduced by <paper num="N3066"/>) seems less reasonable because it requires increment on rvalue iterators of 
class types, and the semantics of such increment is largely unspecified.
<p/>
Perhaps only the new definition should be used.
