<p>
The definitions for execution character set and execution wide-character set were reworded and moved to 
<sref ref="[character.seq.general]"/>/p1.2 after applying CWG motion 10 "<paper num="P2314R4"/> Character 
sets and encodings", but I can't figure out what these terms mean from the wording, which now reads:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"The <i>execution character set</i> and the <i>execution wide-character set</i> are supersets of the 
basic literal character set (5.3 [lex.charset]). The encodings of the execution character sets and the 
sets of additional elements (if any) are locale-specific."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Would it be possible to provide complete definitions for these and give examples of each?

Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Should say <em>something</em>, even if just "unspecified".
<paper num="P1885R9"/> will expose the possible encoding programmatically,
so could say it's implementationd-defined and implementations can document
that you should ask <code>std::text_encoding</code>.
