<p>
<sref ref="[allocator.adaptor.members]"/>/10 requires that the argument types in the piecewise-construction tuples 
all be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>. These tuples are typically created by <tt>std::forward_as_tuple</tt>, such as in 
&para;13. So they will be a mix of lvalue and rvalue references, the latter of which are not <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>.
<p/>
My guess is that <tt>CopyConstructible</tt> was specified to feed the <tt>tuple_cat</tt>, before that function could 
handle rvalues. Since the argument tuple is already moved in &para;11, the requirement is obsolete. It should either 
be changed to <tt>MoveConstructible</tt>, or perhaps better, convert the whole tuple to references (i.e. form 
<tt>tuple&lt;Args1&amp;&amp;...&gt;</tt>) so nothing needs to be moved. After all, this is a facility for handling non-movable 
types.
<p/>
It appears that the resolution of DR <iref ref="2203"/>, which added <tt>std::move</tt> to &para;11, simply omitted the 
change to &para;10.
