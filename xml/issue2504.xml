<sref ref="[streambuf]"/> p1 says:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
The class template <tt>basic_streambuf&lt;charT, traits&gt;</tt> serves as an abstract base class for deriving various
stream buffers whose objects each control two character sequences: [&hellip;]
</p></blockquote>
<p>
The term "abstract base class" is not defined in the standard, but "abstract class" is (<sref ref="[class.abstract]"/>).
<p/>
According to the synopsis <tt>basic_streambuf</tt> has no pure virtual
functions so is not an abstract class and none of libstdc++, libc++, or
dinkumware implement it as an abstract class. I don't believe the wording was
ever intended to require it to be an abstract class, but it could be
read that way.
<p/>
I suggest the wording be changed to "polymorphic base class" or
something else that can't be seen to imply a normative requirement to
make it an abstract class.
