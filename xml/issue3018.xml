<p>
<tt>shared_ptr</tt> has been designed to support use cases where it owns a pointer to function, and whose deleter 
does something with it. This can be used, for example, to keep a dynamic library loaded for as long as their exported 
functions are referenced.
<p/>
Implementations have overlooked that the <tt>T</tt> in <tt>shared_ptr&lt;T&gt;</tt> can be a function type. It isn't 
immediately obvious from the standard, and it's not possible to tell from the wording that this is intentional.

<p/>
-2- Specializations of <tt>shared_ptr</tt> shall be <tt>CopyConstructible</tt>, <tt>CopyAssignable</tt>, and 
<tt>LessThanComparable</tt>, allowing their use in standard containers. Specializations of <tt>shared_ptr</tt> shall be 
contextually convertible to <tt>bool</tt>, allowing their use in boolean expressions and declarations in conditions. 
<del>The template parameter <tt>T</tt> of <tt>shared_ptr</tt> may be an incomplete type.</del>
<p/>
<ins>-?- The template parameter <tt>T</tt> of <tt>shared_ptr</tt> may be an incomplete type. <tt>T*</tt> shall be an object 
pointer type or a function pointer type.</ins>
