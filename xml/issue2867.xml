<p><b>Addresses GB 40</b></p>

<p>The freedom referenced in footnote 189 was curtailed in C++11 to allow only non-throwing specifications. 
The footnote is both wrong, and unnecessary.</p>

<p>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
Strike footnote 189.
</p>

<note>2017-02-03, Daniel comments</note>
<p>
The referenced footnote had the following content in the ballot document <a href="http://wg21.link/n4604">N4604</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
That is, an implementation may provide an explicit exception-specification that defines the subset of "any" exceptions thrown
by that function. This implies that the implementation may list implementation-defined types in such an exception-specification.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In <a href="http://wg21.link/n4618">N4618</a> this footnote has already been removed, I therefore suggest to resolve the
issue as "Resolved by editorial change".
