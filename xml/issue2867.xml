<p><b>Addresses GB 40</b></p>

<p>The freedom referenced in footnote 189 was curtailed in C++11 to allow only non-throwing specifications. 
The footnote is both wrong, and unnecessary.</p>

<p>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
Strike footnote 189.
</p>

<p>
The referenced footnote had the following content in the ballot document <a href="http://wg21.link/n4604">N4604</a>:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
That is, an implementation may provide an explicit exception-specification that defines the subset of "any" exceptions thrown
by that function. This implies that the implementation may list implementation-defined types in such an exception-specification.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In <a href="http://wg21.link/n4618">N4618</a> this footnote has already been removed, I therefore suggest to resolve the
issue as "Resolved by editorial change".
</p>

<p>
Just to confirm that issue 2867 was filed when it looked like the paper to remove
exception specifications from the language had missed C++17. The very specific
edit requested by the issue can be found in the paper <a href="http://wg21.link/p0003r5">P0003R5</a> that was applied.
<p/>
I sugget we mark as resolved by the above paper, rather than "resolved editorially".
<p/>
As author of both the paper and the issue, I would be happy to see it marked
resolved without spending precious LWG time on it in Kona.
