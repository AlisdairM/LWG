<p>
The seemingly non-normative (?) paragraph 61 (referring to N3936) describing how "most machines" define 
<tt>std::numeric_limits&lt;T&gt;::is_modulo</tt> in [numeric.limits.members] appears to have some issues, in my opinion.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p>
-61- On most machines, this is <tt>false</tt> for floating types, <tt>true</tt> for unsigned integers, and <tt>true</tt> 
for signed integers.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Issues I see:
</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Very minor: change clause 2 to "this is <tt>false</tt> for floating <ins>point</ins> types". Other uses of the term 
say "floating point types" rather than just "floating types" &mdash; see nearby <tt>is_iec559</tt>, <tt>tinyness_before</tt>, 
etc.</p></li>
<li><p><tt>is_modulo</tt> <em>must</em> be <tt>true</tt> for unsigned integers in order to be compliant with the Standard; 
this is not just for "most machines". For reference, this requirement is from [basic.fundamental] paragraph 4 with its 
footnote 48.</p></li>
<li><p>Depending on the definition of "most machines", <tt>is_modulo</tt> could be <tt>false</tt> for most machines' signed 
integer types. GCC, Clang and Visual Studio, the 3 most popular C++ compilers by far, by default treat signed integer overflow 
as undefined.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>
As an additional note regarding the definition of <tt>is_modulo</tt>, it seems like it should be explicitly mentioned that 
on an implementation for which signed integer overflow is undefined, <tt>is_modulo</tt> shall be <tt>false</tt> for signed 
integer types. It took bugs filed for all three of these compilers before they finally changed (or planned to change) 
<tt>is_modulo</tt> to <tt>false</tt> for signed types.
</p>

HH: agree with the proposal, don't like the phrasing<br/>
AM: second note feels a bit wooly<br/>
WB: not even happy with the first note, notes shouldn't say "shall"<br/>
JW: the original isn't very prescriptive because "on most machines" is not something the standard controls.<br/>
AM: "On most machines" should become a note too?<br/>
AM: first note is repeating something defined in core, shouldn't say it normatively here. Change "shall" to "is"?<br/>
MC: don't like "signed integer overflow is left undefined" ... it's just plain undefined.<br/>
AM: implementations can define what they do in that case and provide guarantees.<br/>
WB: in paragraph 61, would like to see "this" replaced by "is_modulo"<br/>
AM: Move to Open

<note>2016-05-21 Melissa Mears comments and provides improved wording</note>
<p>
GCC and Clang have <tt>-fwrapv</tt> and MSVC (as of a May 2016 preview build)
has <tt>/d2UndefIntOverflow-</tt> as compiler command line flags to define
signed integer overflow as wrapping.  Such implementations can't set
<tt>is_modulo</tt> to <tt>true</tt> for signed integer types when these options are
enabled, because if translation units using opposite settings were
linked together, the One Definition Rule would be violated.
