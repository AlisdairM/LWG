<sref ref="[allocator.traits.types]"/>/11 says that the instantiation of <tt>rebind_alloc</tt> is 
sometimes ill-formed, however, it's unclear such ill-formedness results in substitution failure or hard error.
It seems that current implementations (libc++, libstd++, MSVC STL) give substitution errors, and 
we should reword <sref ref="[allocator.traits.types]"/>/11 with "<i>Constraints:</i>".

<p>
This issue has some overlap with LWG <iref ref="3545"/> in regard to the question how we should handle
the <tt>rebind</tt> member template of the <tt>pointer_traits</tt> primary template as specified by 
<sref ref="[pointer.traits.types]"/> p3. It would seem preferable to decide for the same approach in both 
cases.

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Probably NAD, since [allocator.requirements.general]/11 allows any allocator
instantiation to fail with a hard error outside the immediate context,
making it impossible to guarantee a SFINAE-friendly result.
Also unclear what motivation there is for it being SFINAE friendly.
