<p>Variants cannot properly support allocators, as any assignment of a subsequent value throws away the allocator used at construction. This is not an easy problem to solve, so variant would be better served dropping the illusion of allocator support for now, leaving open the possibility to provide proper support once the problems are fully understood.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Strike the 8 allocator aware constructor overloads from the class definition, and strike 20.7.2.1 [variant.ctor] p34/35. Strike clause 20.7.12 [variant.traits]. Strike the specialization of <tt>uses_allocator</tt> for variant in the &lt;variant&gt; header synopsis, 20.7.1 [variant.general].</p>
