<title>File position not an offset unimplementable</title>

<p>Table 88, in I/O, is too strict; it's unimplementable on systems
where a file position isn't just an offset. It also never says just
what <code>fpos&lt;&gt;</code> is really supposed to be.  [Here's my summary, which
Jerry agrees is more or less accurate. &quot;I think I now know what
the class really is, at this point: it's a magic cookie that
encapsulates an <code>mbstate_t</code> and a file position (possibly represented as
an <code>fpos_t</code>), it has syntactic support for pointer-like arithmetic, and
implementors are required to have real, not just syntactic, support
for arithmetic.&quot; This isn't standardese, of course.] </p>

<rationale>
<p>Not a defect. The LWG believes that the Standard is already clear,
and that the above summary is what the Standard in effect says.</p>
