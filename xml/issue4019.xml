<title>Reversing an infinite range leads to an infinite loop</title>

<p>
Consider the following:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
auto a = views::iota(0) | views::reverse;
auto b = views::repeat(42) | views::reverse;
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
Here, <tt>views::iota(0)</tt> and <tt>views::repeat(42)</tt> are both non-common bidirectional (even random-access) ranges. 
They are also infinite ranges, even if the standard doesn't really recognize that. 
<p/>
<tt>views::reverse</tt> on a non-common range will actually compute the end iterator for you. So while both declarations 
of <tt>a</tt> and <tt>b</tt> above compile, attempting to use either in any way will lead to an infinite loop when you 
<tt>try a.begin()</tt> or <tt>b.begin()</tt>.
<p/>
A reddit post suggested disallowing reversing a non-common range but that likely breaks reasonable use-cases. We could at
the very least recognize ranges whose sentinel is <tt>unreachable_t</tt> and reject those from consideration. For instance, 
we could change <sref ref="[range.iter.op.next]"/>/3 to <i>Mandate</i> that <tt>S</tt> is not <tt>unreachable_t</tt>.
</p>

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll. Ask SG9 to look. Probably needs a paper.
</p>
<p>
Infinite ranges are invalid and giving an invalid range to the library is
undefined. But this is not a particularly satisfactory answer given that
we provide such ranges ourselves...

Poll: SG9 and LWG believe this is not a defect?

Weak consensus => needs to go to LEWG
</p>
<p>
Poll: SG9 and LWG agree that standard could do something to create
fewer sharp edges here, and we encourage a paper exploring options.
