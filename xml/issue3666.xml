<p>
Despite the fact that <tt>join_view</tt> may produce more elements than each joined view(s) 
contains, we require implementations to use the <tt>common_type</tt> of their difference types 
(per <sref ref="[range.join.iterator]"/> p3), which may lead to UB. As we already have provided 
implementation freedom to define extended integer-like types we should make provision for them 
to be used here as well. The same issue applies to the <tt>join_with_view</tt> as proposed by
<paper num="P2441"/>.
