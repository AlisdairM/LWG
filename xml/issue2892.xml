<b>Addresses GB 38</b>

<p>Relax the prohibition on libraries adding constexpr; this was a constraint requested by library implementers when constexpr was new, and those same implementers now feel unduly constrained.</p>
<p>Proposed change: Rewrite the whole sub-clause to support libraries adding constexpr in a compatible manner, much like the freedom to add a noexcept specification.</p>
