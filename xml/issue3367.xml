<title>Integer-class conversions should not throw</title>

<p>
It's widely established that neither conversions of integral types to <tt>bool</tt> nor conversions 
between different integral types throw exceptions. These properties are crucial to supporting exception 
guarantees in algorithms, containers, and other uses of iterators and their difference types. 
Integer-class types must provide the same guarantees to support the same use cases as do integer types.

<li><p>We probably need to think about providing the stronger guarantee that all integer-class operations 
are also <tt>noexcept</tt> in addition to the guarantee that they do not throw any exceptions.</p></li>
<li><p>The fixed wording in LWG <iref ref="3358"/>, <sref ref="[span.cons]"/> p9 depends on the no-throw-guarantee 
of integer-class conversions to integral types.</p></li>
