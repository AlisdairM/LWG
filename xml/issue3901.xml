<p>
LWG <iref ref="3870"/> made <tt>std::construct_at</tt> unable to create an object of a <i>cv</i>-qualified type, 
which affects <tt>std::uninitialized_construct_using_allocator</tt>. However, uses-allocator construction is 
currently not required to be equivalent to some call to <tt>std::uninitialized_construct_using_allocator</tt>, 
which possibly implies that uses-allocator construction of a <i>cv</i>-qualified type may still be required to be 
well-formed.
<p/>
Should we make such construction ill-formed?

<p>Set status to Tentatively NAD.</p>
<p>Not all uses-allocator construction is done using <code>construct_at</code>.
<code>std::tuple&lt;const T&gt;(allocator_arg, alloc)</code> does
uses-allocator construction of a const type, so we can't make it ill-formed.
