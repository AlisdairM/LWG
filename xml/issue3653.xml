<p>
The <tt>&lt;coroutine&gt;</tt> header is required for freestanding implementations, but it defines a 
specialization of <tt>std::hash</tt>, which is not required for freestanding implementations.
<p/>
Presumably we should make the <tt>std::hash</tt> specialization conditionally present.

<p>
Set priority to 3 after reflector poll.
Would be resolved by <paper num="P1642"/> for C++23,
but it's still a defect in C++20.
