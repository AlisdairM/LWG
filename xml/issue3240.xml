Quoting <sref ref="[using.headers]"/> p3:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"[&hellip;] and shall include the header lexically before the first reference in that translation
 unit to any of the entities declared in that header."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This suggests we may be able to use macros and typedefs (like <tt>size_t</tt>) declared in 
standard headers without the corresponding <tt>#include</tt>. Clearly that is not the intended 
behavior!
<p/>
I thought about replacing 'entity' with 'name', but the same name may occur with
different contexts throughout the standard library. I thought about "contents of that
header", but run afoul of the same function overloads (<tt>std::begin</tt> etc.) being declared
in multiple headers.
<p/>
It may be simpler to turn this sentence around, along the lines of:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"No part of the standard library shall be used in a translation unit prior to a including
or importing a header that provides that feature.”
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Even here, 'used' may be a problematic term of art. Perhaps "named"?
