<title>Are views really supposed to have strict O(1) destruction?</title>

<p>
The second bullet of <sref ref="[range.view]"/> paragraph 3 says
"Examples of views are:[...]
A range type that holds its elements by shared_ptr
and shares ownership with all its copies".
That clearly does not have O(1) destruction in all cases.
However, that does seem like a useful type of view,
and is related to the discussions around the proposed std::generator.
</p>

<p>
What is the purpose of requiring O(1) destruction?
Would it still be achieved by weakening it slightly to something like
"If N copies and/or moves are made from a view that yields M values,
destroying all of them takes time proportional to at worst O(N+M)"?
This in particular prevents the O(N*M) case that I think the rules
are trying to prevent,
while still allowing some more interesting types of views.
</p>

<p>
If instead we actually really do want strict O(1) destruction,
then the example needs to be fixed.
