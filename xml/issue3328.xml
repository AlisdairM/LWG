<p><b>Addresses <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/nbballot/issues/371">NL 375</a></b></p>

<p>
Example in deprecated section implies that <tt>std::string</tt> is the type to use for utf8 strings.
</p>
<blockquote><p>
[<i>Example:</i> A string is to be read from a database that is encoded in UTF-8, and used
to create a directory using the native encoding for filenames:
<pre>
namespace fs = std::filesystem;
std::string utf8_string = read_utf8_data();
fs::create_directory(fs::u8path(utf8_string));
</pre>
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Proposed change:
</p>
<p>
Add clarification that <tt>std::string</tt> is the wrong type for utf8 strings
</p>
<p>
<b>Jeff Garland:</b>
<p/>
SG16 in Belfast: Recommend to accept with a modification to update the example in
<sref ref="[depr.fs.path.factory]"/> p4 to state that <tt>std::u8string</tt> should
be preferred for UTF-8 data.
<p/>
Rationale: The example code is representative of historic use of <tt>std::filesystem::u8path</tt>
and should not be changed to use <tt>std::u8string</tt>. The recommended change is to a
non-normative example and may therefore be considered editorial.

For POSIX-based operating systems with the native narrow encoding set to UTF-8,
no encoding or type conversion occurs.
<p/>
For POSIX-based operating systems with the native narrow encoding not set to UTF-8,
a conversion to UTF-32 occurs, followed by a conversion to the current native narrow
encoding. Some Unicode characters may have no native character set representation.

For Windows-based operating systems a conversion from UTF-8 to UTF-16 occurs. &mdash;

Requested changes:
<ul>
<li>Historic =&gt; historical.</li>
<li>Add missing :: before u8path.</li>
<li>Remove ISO rules forbidden 'should' in a note.</li>
<li>Use language describing why new code should use the u8string constructor
rather than preaching that new code should do something.</li>
</ul>
Billy O'Neal provides updated wording.
