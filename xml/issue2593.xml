<title>Moved-from state of Allocators</title>
<section><sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/></section>

<p>
<sref ref="[allocator.requirements]"/> suggests that the moved-from state of an allocator may be unequal to its 
previous state. Such a move constructor would break most container implementations, which move-construct the 
embedded allocator along with a compressed pair. Even if a moved-from container is empty, it should still 
subsequently allocate from the same resource pool as it did before.
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
std::vector&lt;int, pool&gt; a(500, my_pool);
auto b = std::move(a); // b uses my_pool too.
a.resize(500); // should still use my_pool.
</pre></blockquote>

<p>Marshall will see if this can be resolved editorially.</p>

<p>
After discussion, the editors and I decided that this could not be handled editorially. 
The bit about a moved-from state of an allocator being the same as the original state is a
normative change. I submitted a <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/pull/727">pull request</a>
to handle the mismatched variables in the table.

Note there's an editorial error in Table 28 in that line and the surrounding ones. The left column was apparently 
updated to use <tt>u</tt> and the right column is still using <tt>a</tt>/<tt>a1</tt>/<tt>b</tt>.

<p>
According to the current working draft, the situation has changed due to changes performed by the project editor, the revised 
resolution has been adjusted to N4594.

<note>2016-08 - Chicago</note>
<p>Thurs AM: Moved to LEWG, as this decision (should allocators only be copyable, not movable) is design.</p>

<note>2017-02 in Kona, LEWG responds</note>
<p>Alisdair Meredith says that if you have a do-not-propagate-on-move-assignment, 
then the move of the allocator must compare equal to the original.</p>
<p>Have a data structure where all allocators are equal. 
Construct an element somewhere else moving from inside the container 
(which doesn't have a POCMA trait); you don't want the allocator of the
moved-from element to now be different. So in that case, the allocator's 
move constructor must behave the same as copy.</p>
<p>We don't need to go as far as this issue, but going that far is ok for Bloomberg.</p>

<note>2017-06-02 Issues Telecon</note>
<p>We discussed containers that have sentinel nodes, etc, and so might have to 
allocate/deallocate using a moved-from allocator - and decided that we didn't
want any part of that</p>
<p>Adjusted the wording slightly, and moved to Tentatively Ready</p>
