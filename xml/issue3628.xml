<p>
Most uninitialized memory algorithms (<sref ref="[specialized.algorithms]"/>) are specified by 
plain "<i>Effects:</i> Equivalent to:". According to <sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/>/4, 
such wording requires propagation of "<i>Constraints</i>" of selected constructors. The first two 
overloads of <tt>std::reduce</tt> (<sref ref="[reduce]"/>) are specified similarly.
<p/>
I feel the wording for uninitialized memory algorithms is incorrect, because it means that the 
constraints, especially for algorithms in the <tt>std</tt>, depend on "<tt>Constraints</tt>" in 
the specifications of many standard library types (but not any user-defined type), which is 
implementable but brings serious inconsistency.
<p/>
Perhaps we should add "<i>Mandates:</i>" to these algorithms (except for algorithms in <tt>std::ranges</tt>).

Tim:
"P2. Not for this particular case (I'm pretty sure there'll be agreement
that this shouldn't induce any constraint), but for the more general
issue of "<em>Effects:</em> Equivalent to" propagating <em>Constraints:</em>;
I'm not sure that's the right approach in general (unlike the other elements,
<em>Constraints:</em> requires special handling beyond "use this code" and is
pretty hard to work through if we have a lengthy code block) - and it
certainly doesn't really make a lot of sense to propagate <em>Constraints:</em>
but not actual core-language constraints."
