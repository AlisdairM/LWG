<p>
With regard to Random number engine class templates <sref ref="[rand.eng]"/>,
the Standard can be read in two different ways: when the member function
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
.seed(result_type s = default_seed)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
is invoked, is all associated state (such as carry) reset to the same
state that would have been created by the constructor
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
explicit <em>engine-type</em>(result_type s = default_seed)
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
or is the exact state unspecified?
<p/>
Implementations differ.

Walter Brown says that Table 117 makes this very clear, and that the answer is "Yes"
