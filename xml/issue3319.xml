<p>
This paragraph says 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"27.11 describes an interface for accessing the IANA Time Zone database described in RFC 6557, &hellip;"
</p></blockquote>
<p>
However, RFC 6557 does not describe the database itself; it only describes the maintenance procedures 
for that database, as its title implies (quoted in clause 2).
<p/>
Proposed change:
<p/>
Add a reference to a specification of the database itself, or excise all references to the IANA
time zone database.
</p>
<p>
<b>Howard Hinnant:</b>
<p/>
We can not entirely remove the reference to IANA because we need portable <code>time_zone</code> 
names (e.g. "America/New_York") and definitions. However the NB comment is quite accurate and 
fixed with the proposed resolution.
