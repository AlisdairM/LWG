<p>
The effects in <sref ref="[socket.streambuf.members]"/> p3 say that the function loops through every endpoint in the 
sequence, attempting to establish a connection. It needs to say that as soon as a connection is successfully established 
it returns. Otherwise even if a connection is made, it closes the socket and tries the next endpoint in the sequence. 
That means it will always be left in whatever state resulted from trying the last endpoint in the sequence (or from 
timing out if the expiry time was reached before iterating through all endpoints).
