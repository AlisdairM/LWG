<b>Addresses: networking.ts</b>
<p>
<tt>make_service</tt> and <tt>use_service</tt> create arbitrary numbers of type <tt>Service</tt>, a type provided 
by the user, similar to how locale's <tt>use_facet</tt> works. As a result there's no amount of storage that could 
be reserved inside <tt>execution_context</tt> to avoid allocating memory. However, there's no allocator support 
here, and <tt>make_service</tt> is forbidden from throwing allocation related exceptions by 
<a href="http://wg21.link/n4734">N4734</a> [async.exec.ctx.globals]/7.
<p/>
If the intent is for <tt>execution_context</tt> to allocate memory, are user overloads of <tt>operator new</tt> 
on type <tt>Service</tt> intended to be used?
