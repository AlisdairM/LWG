<p>
The library's definition of the term "required behavior" (<sref ref="[defns.required.behavior]"/>) makes it specific to 
certain replaceable functions such as the replaceable global allocation functions. Notably, it is not one of the elements 
that are allowed to appear in the descriptions of general function semantics. That is, it isn't in the list in 
<sref ref="[structure.specifications]"/> p3.
<p/>
However, the specification of the random number generator library uses "Required behavior" as such a descriptive element 
of its functions' semantics (e.g., <sref ref="[rand.predef]"/>).
<p/>
I think that's a fine use of "Required behavior", so I would like the term to be more generally applicable to the behavior 
of any stdlib function that may be customized by users. This is relevant for <tt>std::execution</tt>, where algorithms are 
customizable but the customizations are required to behave a certain way. 
<p/>

<p/>
Bullet (2.4) of <sref ref="[res.on.functions]"/> also contradicts to the more narrow definition of 
<sref ref="[defns.required.behavior]"/> by suddenly extending it to "destructor operations".
