<p>noexcept is inconsistently applied across headers which import components of the C standard library into the C++ library; some functions (std::abort(), std::_Exit(), etc) are defined as noexcept in some places, but not in others. Some functions which seem like they should be noexcept (std::abs(), std::div(), etc) are not defined as noexcept.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Make the majority of the C library functions (with exceptions such as std::qsort() and std::bsearch(), which can call user code) noexcept.</p>
