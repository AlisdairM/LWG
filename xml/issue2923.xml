<p><tt>noexcept</tt> is inconsistently applied across headers which import components of the C standard library into the C++ library; 
some functions (<tt>std::abort()</tt>, <tt>std::_Exit()</tt>, etc) are defined as <tt>noexcept</tt> in some places, but not in others. 
Some functions which seem like they should be <tt>noexcept</tt> (<tt>std::abs()</tt>, <tt>std::div()</tt>, etc) are not defined as 
<tt>noexcept</tt>.</p>

<p>Proposed change: Make the majority of the C library functions (with exceptions such as <tt>std::qsort()</tt> and 
<tt>std::bsearch()</tt>, which can call user code) <tt>noexcept</tt>.</p>
