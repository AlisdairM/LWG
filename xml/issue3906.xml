This was originally <a href="https://github.com/cplusplus/draft/issues/6185">editorial issue #6185</a>.
<p/>
The term "undefined address" is used in <sref ref="[atomics.types.pointer]"/>/8 and 
<sref ref="[atomics.ref.pointer]"/>/6, however, it seems not properly defined and the intended meaning is unclear.
The term originally appeared in the paper <paper num="N2393"/> and was reused by <paper num="P0019R8"/>, but 
no explanation can be found in these papers.
<p/>
Perhaps "undefined address" is related to the undefined behavior specified in <sref ref="[expr.add]"/>.
