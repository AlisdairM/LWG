<title>Library needs to specify what it means when it declares a function <tt>constexpr</tt></title>

<p>
The library has lots of functions declared <tt>constexpr</tt>, but it's not clear what that means. The <tt>constexpr</tt> 
keyword implies that there needs to be <em>some</em> invocation of the function, for <em>some</em> set of template 
arguments and function arguments, that is valid in a constant expression (otherwise the program would be ill-formed, 
with no diagnostic required), along with a few side conditions. I suspect the library intends to require something a 
lot stronger than that from implementations (something along the lines of "all calls that could reasonably be constant 
subexpressions are in fact constant subexpressions, unless otherwise stated").
<p/>
[variant.ctor]/1 contains this, which should also be fixed:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if and only if the value-initialization of the alternative type <tt>T0</tt> 
would satisfy the requirements for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the wrong constraint: instead of constraining whether the function is <tt>constexpr</tt>, we should constrain 
whether a call to it is a constant subexpression.
</p>

This is has some considerable overlap with LWG <iref ref="2289"/> but is phrased in a more general way.
