<title>Library needs to specify what it means when it declares a function <tt>constexpr</tt></title>

<p>
The library has lots of functions declared <tt>constexpr</tt>, but it's not clear what that means. The <tt>constexpr</tt> 
keyword implies that there needs to be <em>some</em> invocation of the function, for <em>some</em> set of template 
arguments and function arguments, that is valid in a constant expression (otherwise the program would be ill-formed, 
with no diagnostic required), along with a few side conditions. I suspect the library intends to require something a 
lot stronger than that from implementations (something along the lines of "all calls that could reasonably be constant 
subexpressions are in fact constant subexpressions, unless otherwise stated").
<p/>
[variant.ctor]/1 contains this, which should also be fixed:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
"This function shall be <tt>constexpr</tt> if and only if the value-initialization of the alternative type <tt>T0</tt> 
would satisfy the requirements for a <tt>constexpr</tt> function."
</p></blockquote>
<p>
This is the wrong constraint: instead of constraining whether the function is <tt>constexpr</tt>, we should constrain 
whether a call to it is a constant subexpression.

This is has some considerable overlap with LWG <iref ref="2289"/> but is phrased in a more general way.

<p>Priority 2; this is also the general case of <iref ref="2829"/>.</p>

<note>2017-02-20, Alisdair comments and suggests concrete wording</note>
<p>
Below is is draft wording I was working on at Issaquah to try to address both issues.

<p>
This wording is relative to <a href="http://wg21.link/n4640">N4640</a>.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>
Modify <sref ref="[constexpr.functions]"/> as indicated:
</p>
<blockquote>
<h3>17.6.5.6 <tt>constexpr</tt> functions and constructors [constexpr.functions]</h3>
<p>
-1- This International Standard explicitly requires that certain standard library functions are
<tt>constexpr</tt> (<sref ref="[dcl.constexpr]"/>).  <ins>If the specification for a templated entity
requires that it shall be a <tt>constexpr</tt> templated entity, then that
templated entity shall be usable in a constant expression.</ins>.  An
implementation <del>shall not</del><ins>may</ins> declare
<del>any</del><ins>additional</ins> standard library function signature as
<tt>constexpr</tt> <del>except for those where it is explicitly required</del>.
Within any header that provides any non-defining declarations of
<tt>constexpr</tt> functions or constructors an implementation shall provide
corresponding definitions.
