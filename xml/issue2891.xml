<b>Addresses GB 35</b>

<p>Most implementations have poor testing and support for instantiating standard library templates with <tt>volatile</tt>-qualified 
types. We should grant a library-freedom to conforming implementations so that support for <tt>volatile</tt> (and <tt>const volatile</tt>)
qualified types in standard library templates is not required unless explicitly specified &mdash; and mandate such support for all 
templates in the <tt>&lt;type_traits&gt;</tt> header. Additional support is already specified in most places we would be interested 
(e.g., tuple API). We may want to additionally guarantee support through forwarding references.</p>
<p>Proposed change: add a new 17.6.5.x Volatile Qualified Types [res.on.volatile.type] describing the intended level of support for 
<tt>volatile</tt> qualifiers.</p>
