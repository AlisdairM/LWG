<title>Sorting a range of <tt>pair</tt>s</title>

Consider this example:
</p>
<blockquote><pre>
#include &lt;algorithm&gt;
#include &lt;ranges&gt;

int main() {
  int a[3] = {1, 2, -1};
  int b[3] = {1, 4, 1};
  std::ranges::sort(std::views::zip(a, b));
}
</pre></blockquote>
<p>
This is currently valid C++23 code, but wasn't before <paper num="P2165"/> (Compatibility between <tt>tuple</tt>, <tt>pair</tt> 
and <i>tuple-like</i> objects). Before P2165, <tt>zip(a, b)</tt> returned a range whose reference was 
<tt>std::pair&lt;int&amp;, int&amp;&gt;</tt> and whose <tt>value_type</tt> was <tt>std::pair&lt;int, int&gt;</tt> and 
<tt>std::pair</tt>, unlike <tt>std::tuple</tt>, does not have any heterogeneous comparisons &mdash; which is required to 
satisfy the <tt>sortable</tt> concept. 
<p/>
While the zip family of range adapters no longer has this problem, nothing prevents users from themselves creating a range 
whose reference type is <tt>pair&lt;T&amp;, U&amp;&gt;</tt> and whose <tt>value_type</tt> is <tt>pair&lt;T, U&gt;</tt> 
(which is now a valid range after the zip paper) and then discovering that this range isn't sortable, even though the 
equivalent using <tt>tuple</tt> is. 
<p/>
Suggested resolution:
<p/>
Change <tt>pair</tt>'s comparison operators from comparing two arguments of type <tt>const pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;&amp;</tt> 
to instead comparing arguments of types <tt>const pair&lt;T1, T2&gt;&amp;</tt> and <tt>const pair&lt;U1, U2&gt;&amp;</tt>.
