I initially brought this issue up on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23955828/how-to-use-basic-ostringstream-with-stateful-custom-allocator-c11">Stack Overflow</a>, 
where I was then told to make a topic about this problem on <a href="https://groups.google.com/a/isocpp.org/d/msg/std-discussion/kAQFOWz47m0/cOXSHa5Iwg4J">std-discussion</a>, 
where I was then in turn asked to report the issue.
<p/>
The problem: The <tt>std::basic_ostringstream</tt> class template can be instantiated with an allocator type, but none of the 
constructors provided accept an allocator argument, which means it's impossible to use <tt>std::basic_ostringstream</tt> with 
stateful allocators. The C++ Standard Library Defect Report List seems to already mention a similar issue (<iref ref="2210"/>).
