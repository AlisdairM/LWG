<p>
The specification of <tt><i>awaitable-receiver</i></tt> in <sref ref="[exec.as.awaitable]"/>/p4 
as of <paper num="N4988"/> is not taking into consideration the fact that the <tt>resume()</tt> 
and <tt>promise()</tt> member functions on <tt>coroutine_handle&lt;P&gt;</tt> are not marked <tt>noexcept</tt>. 
<tt><i>awaitable-receiver</i></tt>'s member functions must all be <tt>noexcept</tt>, but they are 
specified as being "equivalent to" statement that call <tt>resume()</tt> and <tt>promise()</tt> 
outside of <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt> blocks.
